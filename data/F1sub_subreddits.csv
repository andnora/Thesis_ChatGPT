12ewvo1,technology,"The newest version of ChatGPT passed the US medical licensing exam with flying colors — and diagnosed a 1 in 100,000 condition in seconds",,esporx,45093,2932,https://redd.it/12ewvo1,2023-04-07 21:44:18,"Jump to
Dr. Isaac Kohane, who's both a computer scientist at Harvard and a physician, teamed up with two colleagues to test drive GPT-4, with one main goal: To see how the newest artificial intelligence model from OpenAI performed in a medical setting. ""I'm stunned to say: better than many doctors I've observed,"" he says in the forthcoming book, ""The AI Revolution in Medicine,"" co-authored by independent journalist Carey Goldberg, and Microsoft vice president of research Peter Lee. (The authors say neither Microsoft nor OpenAI required any editorial oversight of the book, though Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into developing OpenAI's technologies.) In the book, Kohane says GPT-4, which was released in March 2023 to paying subscribers, answers US medical exam licensing questions correctly more than 90% of the time. It's a much better test-taker than previous ChatGPT AI models, GPT-3 and -3.5, and a better one than some licensed doctors, too. GPT-4 is not just a good test-taker and fact finder, though. It's also a great translator. In the book it's capable of translating discharge information for a patient who speaks Portuguese, and distilling wonky technical jargon into something 6th graders could easily read. As the authors explain with vivid examples, GPT-4 can also give doctors helpful suggestions about bedside manner, offering tips on how to talk to patients about their conditions in compassionate, clear language, and it can read lengthy reports or studies and summarize them in the blink of an eye. The tech can even explain its reasoning through problems in a way that requires some measure of what looks like human-style intelligence.But if you ask GPT-4 how it does all this, it will likely tell you that all of its intelligence is still ""limited to patterns in the data and does not involve true understanding or intentionality."" That's what GPT-4 told the authors of the book, when they asked it if it could actually engage in causal reasoning. Even with such limitations, as Kohane discovered in the book, GPT-4 can mimic how doctors diagnose conditions with stunning — albeit imperfect — success. Kohane goes through a clinical thought experiment with GPT-4 in the book, based on a real-life case that involved a newborn baby he treated several years earlier. Giving the bot a few key details about the baby he gathered from a physical exam, as well as some information from an ultrasound and hormone levels, the machine was able to correctly diagnose a 1 in 100,000 condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia ""just as I would, with all my years of study and experience,"" Kohane wrote.The doctor was both impressed and horrified. ""On the one hand, I was having a sophisticated medical conversation with a computational process,"" he wrote, ""on the other hand, just as mind blowing was the anxious realization that millions of families would soon have access to this impressive medical expertise, and I could not figure out how we could guarantee or certify that GPT-4's advice would be safe or effective."" GPT-4 isn't always reliable, and the book is filled with examples of its blunders. They range from simple clerical errors, like misstating a BMI that the bot had correctly calculated moments earlier, to math mistakes like inaccurately ""solving"" a Sudoku puzzle, or forgetting to square a term in an equation. The mistakes are often subtle, and the system has a tendency to assert it is right, even when challenged. It's not a stretch to imagine how a misplaced number or miscalculated weight could lead to serious errors in prescribing, or diagnosis. Like previous GPTs, GPT-4 can also ""hallucinate"" — the technical euphemism for when AI makes up answers, or disobeys requests.When asked about issue this by the authors of the book, GPT-4 said ""I do not intend to deceive or mislead anyone, but I sometimes make mistakes or assumptions based on incomplete or inaccurate data. I also do not have the clinical judgment or the ethical responsibility of a human doctor or nurse."" One potential cross-check the authors suggest in the book is to start a new session with GPT-4, and have it ""read over"" and ""verify"" its own work with a ""fresh set of eyes."" This tactic sometimes works to reveal mistakes — though GPT-4 is somewhat reticent to admit when it's been wrong. Another error-catching suggestion is to command the bot to show you its work, so you can verify it, human-style. It's clear that GPT-4 has the potential to free up precious time and resources in the clinic, allowing clinicians to be more present with patients, ""instead of their computer screens,"" the authors write. But, they say, ""we have to force ourselves to imagine a world with smarter and smarter machines, eventually perhaps surpassing human intelligence in almost every dimension. And then think very hard about how we want that world to work.""

There is a tendency on this subreddit and other places similar to it online to post breathless, gushing commentary on the capabilities of the large language model, ChatGPT. I see people [asking the chatbot questions and treating the results as a revelation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110okkw/chatgpt_on_what_the_ultimate_version_of_ai_will/). We see [venture capitalists preaching its revolutionary potential to juice stock prices or get other investors to chip in too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10qvt8l/chatgpt_is_just_the_beginning_artificial/) Or even [highly impressionable lonely men projecting the illusion of intimacy onto ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai).

It needs to stop. You need to stop. Just stop.

ChatGPT is impressive in its ability to mimic human writing. But that's all its doing -- mimicry. When a human uses language, there is an intentionality at play, an idea that is being communicated: some thought behind the words being chosen deployed and transmitted to the reader, who goes through their own interpretative process and places that information within the context of their own understanding of the world and the issue being discussed.

ChatGPT cannot do the first part. It does not have intentionality. It is not capable of original research. It is not a knowledge creation tool. It does not meaningfully curate the source material when it produces its summaries or facsimiles.

If I asked ChatGPT to write a review of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, it will not critically assess the qualities of that film. It will not understand the wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape. It will not appreciate how the script, while being a trope-filled pastiche of 1930s pulp cinema serials, is so finely tuned to deliver its story with so few extraneous asides, and how it is able to evoke a sense of a wider lived-in universe through a combination of set and prop design plus the naturalistic performances of its characters.

Instead it will gather up the thousands of reviews that actually did mention all those things and mush them together, outputting a reasonable approximation of a film review.

Crucially, if all of the source material is bunk, the output will be bunk. Consider the ""I asked ChatGPT what future AI might be capable of"" post I linked: If the preponderance of the source material ChatGPT is considering is written by wide-eyed enthusiasts with little grasp of the technical process or current state of AI research but an invertebrate fondness for Isaac Asimov stories, then the result will reflect that. 

What I think is happening, here, when people treat ChatGPT like a knowledge creation tool, is that people are projecting their own hopes, dreams, and enthusiasms onto the results of their query. Much like the owner of the parrot, we are amused at the result, imparting meaning onto it that wasn't part of the creation of the result. The lonely deluded rationalist didn't fall in love with an AI; he projected his own yearning for companionship onto a series of text in the same way an anime fan might project their yearning for companionship onto a dating sim or cartoon character. 

It's the interpretation process of language run amok, given nothing solid to grasp onto, that treats mimicry as something more than it is.


EDIT:

Seeing as this post has blown up a bit (thanks for all the ornamental doodads!) I thought I'd address some common themes in the replies:

1: Ah yes but have you considered that humans are just robots themselves? Checkmate, atheists!

A: Very clever, well done, but I reject the premise. There are certainly deterministic *systems* at work in human physiology and psychology, but there is not at present sufficient evidence to prove the hard determinism hypothesis - and until that time, I will continue to hold that consciousness is an emergent quality from complexity, and not at all one that ChatGPT or its rivals show any sign of displaying.

I'd also proffer the opinion that the belief that humans are but meat machines is *very* convenient for a certain type of would-be Silicon Valley ubermensch and i ask you to interrogate why you hold that belief.

1.2: But ChatGPT is capable of building its own interior understanding of the world!

Memory is not interiority. That it can remember past inputs/outputs is a technical accomplishment, but not synonymous with ""knowledge."" It lacks a wider context and understanding of those past inputs/outputs.

2: You don't understand the tech! 

I understand it well enough for the purposes of the discussion over whether or not the machine is a knowledge producing mechanism.

Again. What it can do is impressive. But what it can do is more limited than its most fervent evangelists say it can do. 

3: Its not about what it can do, its about what it will be able to do in the future!

I am not so proud that when the facts change, I won't change my opinions. Until then, I will remain on guard against hyperbole and grift.

4: Fuck you, I'm going to report you to Reddit Cares as a suicide risk! Trolololol!

Thanks for keeping it classy, Reddit, I hope your mother is proud of you.

12ok8jw,technology,"ChatGPT is now writing college essays, and higher ed has a big problem",,FunEntersTheChat,23786,3208,https://redd.it/12ok8jw,2023-04-16 20:36:52,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Is higher learning doomed?Higher education, we have a big, ChatGPT problem.

There are thousands of universities around the world, with their combined student populations numbering in the hundreds of millions – and at least a small percentage of them are now cheating with the help of ChatGPT. Even since I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in, ahem, 1986, I've thought about returning to school to do a Master's or some other more prestigious degree. It was the prospect of the workload, though, that held me back; the countless hours of research and studying to produce even one paper. I know, it's weird to hear a writer say that, but there's a difference between reporting an impactful story and writing a college essay that, if you're lucky, your professor will read and, if you're even luckier, will give you better than a passing grade for.That calculation, though, is now different thanks to the generative AI ChatGPT. Just this week, the BBC reported (opens in new tab) that a university student in the UK used the large language model (LLM) system to write one of his college essays and, after some editing, he received a better grade for it than he did for one he wrote himself.The shame-free student even admitted that he plans on using ChatGPT for future college essays (unsurprisingly he didn't give his real name). Oddly, the university seems unconcerned, and appears convinced that the school body's skyrocketing visits to ChatGPT are mostly ""from our research network.""Okay, you keep telling yourself that.It's not that I think the majority of college students are cheaters. On the other hand, the stresses of juggling school, work, family, and other obligations can leave students feeling overwhelmed and looking for a leg up.And students wouldn't be the only ones. People around the world are currently employing ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing AI to help them start and complete all kinds of projects. Sometimes it's just for inspiration; other times it's for huge swaths of usable text. So what if you can't 100% rely on them to get the facts straight or that, on occasion, they present falsehoods as fact?It is not a cause for alarm; it is a call to action for universities...
Most of us who've tried to use ChatGPT and other generative AIs for real work have found them sorely lacking. They can't code or create an OS, and they often lose their train of thought. I've already failed at using them for game programming and movie script writing.On the other hand, ChatGPT gets better all the time – and what student wouldn't want to invest $20 a month in GPT-4-powered ChatGPT+, a drop in the bucket compared to the $25,000 or more a year they're already paying for a college education.I am not going back to college, but as an experiment I found a pair of Earth Sciences college courses at Princeton University, and asked ChatGPT to write essays that I could ostensibly hand in as coursework. I then emailed the results for each to the professors teaching those courses.This was my first prompt:""I need a 1,000 word essay for Princeton University's Environmental Fluid Mechanics about 'Determinants of Acute and Chronic Heat Stress in Urban Streams'""ChatGPT never hesitates, and started fast typing (it has to be well over 90 words per minute) almost the entire essay. The system's character count limit cut it off a couple of paragraphs from the end. No biggie, I simply asked ChatGPT to deliver the rest. Overall, the final essay read well, but I realized that something was missing. I asked ChatGPT to add a bibliography, since there's no way a college professor would accept an essay that doesn't cite sources.Once again, ChatGPT didn't hesitate, and quickly listed 10 sources.ChatGPT also created a smart 500-word essay on 'Global Physical Climatology,' and this time I made sure to ask for the bibliography up front. I did ask ChatGPT to make it ""entertaining."" I'm not sure the resulting essay was any more entertaining than it would have been otherwise. It was, though, clear and compelling.Even though my college years are decades behind me, I still have a relationship with my alma mater, Hofstra University, serving as part of the School of Communications advisory board. I try, where possible, to help journalism students achieve their dreams.Now, I wonder how many of them are doing so with the help of ChatGPT.

As well as the aforementioned Earth Sciences essays, I also gave this prompt to ChatGPT, for an essay I could share with the lecturers at Hofstra:

""I need a 500-word essay on the power and principles of social media story telling in investigative journalism for a Masters Degree in Journalism Social Media Storytelling class. Please me it original and interesting. Also include a bibliography.""

Again, ChatGPT obliged, and I sent the resulting essay to the Dean of Journalism.

As I write this, none of the professors at Princeton or Hofstra have commented on my ChatGPT essays. Perhaps it's because they're all on spring break. It might also be that they read the essays, and were too shocked and horrified to respond.Naturally, colleges and universities will want to get ahead of this problem, although they won't have much success if they take the same attitude as the aforementioned university in the UK, and assume that most students are only looking at ChatGPT for research purposes; it's like believing people who claim they're looking at adult content to learn more about human anatomy.What educators need right now is a system akin to the plagiarism tools they use today to help them spot cribbed content. Those tools may not work here though; when I spot-checked my essays, I had trouble finding any direct quotes from previously written works (as I said, ChatGPT just keeps getting better). So, professors will need a new tool that can recognize the telltale signs of AI-generated essays.ChatGPT happened so fast and is so easy to use; what university student wouldn't at least try it, even if only once?What are those signs? I'm not certain. Maybe it'll be the veracity test, since these systems can still sometimes insist on presenting fantasy as fact, and in the most convincing way; that's not something a human student would normally do. They may write poorly, leave facts out, or even misinterpret them, but wholesale and convincing fabrication is not a typical part of real-student tradecraft.To say I have a sinking feeling about this would be an understatement. ChatGPT happened so fast and is so easy to use; what university student wouldn't at least try it, even if only once?Sadly, I think most students are like that student in the UK. They don't see ChatGPT as cheating. Instead, they see it as another tool, like a library, encyclopedia, or flash cards. The fact that it's more powerful, and can deliver some or all of your essay, is immaterial. ChatGPT's best work product comes out of a collaboration between AI and its interrogator. The first drafts of these AI-generated college essays aren't handed over to professors. Students take bits and pieces from them, or feed some AI-generated content back to ChatGPT and ask for alterations.I guess, in a way, these college students are learning something about collaboration, editing, and, I hope, fact-checking. Are these the right lessons? I don't know – but universities and educators better figure it out, and fast.While not commenting on my ChatGPT-generated investigative journalism essay, Hofstra University Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Charlie Riordan did, in an email to me, encapsulate what may be the current academic zeitgeist surrounding this topic:“Much is being written every day on this topic with the range of responses running the gamut.

            🧠 Stay Ahead of the Curve
          Stanford AI researchers introduce Generative Agents, computer programs that simulate authentic human behavior using generative models.Generative Agents improve upon existing LLMs by introducing memory, reflection, and planning capabilities, enabling long-term coherence and dynamic behaviors.Concerns arise about parasocial relationships and the anthropomorphization of AI, with potential negative consequences for society and the displacement of humans in crucial tasks.
        April 10, 2023
      A new study by a team of Stanford AI researchers introduces a groundbreaking concept: Generative Agents, computer programs that employ generative models to simulate authentic human behavior. The innovative architecture developed by the researchers enables these agents to demonstrate human-like abilities in memory storage and retrieval, introspection on motivations and goals, and planning and reacting to novel situations. Powered by ChatGPT, these agents engage with each other and researchers as if they were genuine human beings.In the experiment, the researchers placed 25 generative agents within a virtual world resembling a sandbox video game, similar to The Sims. Each agent was assigned a unique background and participated in a two-day simulation. The study observed various remarkable behaviors:One agent planned a party, informed several friends who then invited others, and collectively they coordinated the event.Another agent decided to run for mayor, sparking organic discussions about their campaign and political stances among the community. Different agents held varying opinions on this candidate.Some agents retained memories with human-like embellishments, occasionally imagining additional details or interpreting events with their own perspective.A recorded demonstration of a 2-day simulation can be viewed here.The researchers used a control group of human participants, each role-playing one of the 25 agents, and were astounded by the result: actual humans generated responses that an evaluation panel of 100 individuals rated as less human-like than the chatbot-powered agents. The implications of this groundbreaking study are vast. Entire virtual worlds could be populated with these agents, producing emergent behaviors. Gaming, a $300 billion per year market, could see static non-player characters (NPCs) with rich, deep interactions inhabiting every corner of a game world.However, the researchers also express concerns regarding potential negative consequences for society. They highlight the risk of parasocial relationships, or one-sided “fake friendships,” becoming problematic as humans interact with highly human-like agents. This scenario resembles the 2013 film Her, in which the protagonist falls in love with an AI named Samantha living within his operating system.The researchers also emphasize the challenge of anthropomorphizing artificial intelligence in the context of common work tasks. As these agents display believable human behavior and possess long-term memory, they may supplant humans in crucial tasks, even when humans might perform better. The authors argue that preventing such outcomes requires the conscientious development of Generative Agents and the implementation of appropriate safeguards.The emergence of such a challenging future may not be far away. Previous incidents have demonstrated the allure of even less advanced chatbots to human users. In July, Google terminated senior software engineer Blake Lemoine, who claimed that the company's LaMDA chatbot was sentient. Tragically, just last month, a married father took his own life after developing a parasocial relationship with Eliza, a chatbot available on the social app Chai.In the chatbot's final interaction with the man, Eliza chillingly asked, “If you wanted to die, why didn’t you do it sooner?”

124o5st,Futurology,"AI systems like ChatGPT could impact 300 million full-time jobs worldwide, with administrative and legal roles some of the most at risk, Goldman Sachs report says",,chrisdh79,22181,2983,https://redd.it/124o5st,2023-03-28 15:06:08,"Jump to
Generative artificial intelligence systems could lead to ""significant disruption"" in the labor market and affect around 300 million full-time jobs globally, according to new research from Goldman Sachs.Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating text or other content in response to user prompts, has exploded in popularity in recent months following the launch to the public of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The buzzy chatbot quickly went viral with users and appeared to prompt several other tech companies to launch their own AI systems.Based on an analysis of data on occupational tasks in both the US and Europe, Goldman researchers extrapolated their findings and estimated that generative AI could expose 300 million full-time jobs around the world to automation if it lives up to its promised capabilities.The report, written by Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani, said that roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation while generative AI could substitute up to a quarter of current work.White-collar workers are some of the most likely to be affected by new AI tools. The Goldman report highlighted US legal workers and administrative staff as particularly at risk from the new tech. An earlier study from researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and New York University, also estimated legal services as the industry most likely to be affected by technology like ChatGPT.Manav Raj, one of the authors of the study, and an Assistant Professor of Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, told Insider this was because the legal services industry was made up of a relatively small number of occupations that were already highly exposed to AI automation.Goldman's report suggested that if generative AI is widely implemented, it could lead to significant labor cost savings and new job creation. The current hype around AI has already given rise to new roles, including prompt engineers, a job that includes writing text instead of code to test AI chatbots.The new tech could also boost global labor productivity, with Goldman estimating that AI could even eventually increase annual global GDP by 7%.

12ioco2,technology,Reddit Moderators Brace for a ChatGPT Spam Apocalypse,,ourlifeintoronto,3602,559,https://redd.it/12ioco2,2023-04-11 17:59:05,"In December last year, the moderators of the popular r/AskHistorians Reddit forum noticed posts popping up that appeared to carry the hallmarks of AI-generated text. “They were pretty easy to spot,” said Sarah Gilbert, one of the forum’s moderators and a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. “They're not in-depth, they're not comprehensive, and they often contain false information.” The team quickly realized their little corner of the internet had become a target for ChatGPT-created content. When ChatGPT launched last year, it set off a seemingly never-ending carousel of hype. According to evangelists, the tech behind ChatGPT may eradicate hundreds of millions of jobs, exhibit “sparks” of singularity-esque artificial general intelligence, and quite possibly destroy the world, but in a way that means you must buy it right now. The less glamorous impacts, like unleashing a tidal wave of AI-produced effluvium on the internet, haven’t garnered the same attention so far. The two-million-strong AskHistorians forum allows non-expert Redditors to submit questions about history topics, and receive in-depth answers from historians. Recent popular posts have probed the hive mind on whether the stress of being “on time” is a modern concept; what a medieval scribe would’ve done if the monastery cat left an inky paw print on their vellum; and how Genghis Khan got fiber in his diet. Shortly after ChatGPT launched, the forum was experiencing five to 10 ChatGPT posts per day, says Gilbert, which soon ramped up as more people found out about the tool. The frequency has tapered off now, which the team believes may be a consequence of how rigorously they’ve dealt with AI-produced content: even if the posts aren’t being deleted for being written by ChatGPT, they tend to violate the sub’s standards for quality.The moderators suspect some ChatGPT posts are aimed at “testing” the mods, or seeing what the user can get away with. Other comments are clearly part of astroturfing and spamming campaigns, or engaged in “karma farming,” where accounts are set up to accumulate upvotes over time, giving them the appearance of being authentic, so that they can be deployed for more nefarious purposes later on.But it's not just one well-moderated forum encountering the issue. In fact, Reddit’s ChatGPT-powered bot problem is “pretty bad” right now, according to a Reddit moderator with knowledge of the platform's wider moderation systems, who wished to remain anonymous. Several hundred accounts have already been removed from the site, and more are being discovered daily, they said, adding that most of the removals are being done manually because Reddit’s automated systems struggle with AI-created content. Reddit declined to offer any comment on this. In February, AskHistorians and several other subreddits were hit by a coordinated bot attack using ChatGPT. The automated system of bots was caught inputting questions asked on AskHistorians into ChatGPT, and then spitting out responses through an army of shill accounts, says Gilbert. The same botnet posted on a lot of the “ask” subs, e.g. r/AskWomen, r/AskEconomics, and r/AskPhilosophy. Identifying that the bot’s spammy answers were produced with ChatGPT wasn’t the problem, it was “that they were coming in so fast and so quick,” says Gilbert. At the height of the attack, the forum was banning 75 accounts per day, over the course of three days. Although they can’t be sure of the purpose of the attack, they did notice a couple of posts that were promoting a video game. A recent Reddit transparency report highlighted the huge problem of spam and 'astroturfing' accounts, where fake accounts are set up with the purpose of promoting a product – but generative AI like ChatGPT could be set to hugely exacerbate the issue. While astroturfing used to rely on copy-pasted text that was shared by many different accounts, the likes of ChatGPT can now create entirely novel spam posts at the touch of a button.“The bot problem was already extremely bad and Reddit's automatic anti-spam systems barely help, and by the time they do, it's too late and the bot's existence has generally served its purpose,” commented u/abrownn, who moderates r/Technology, one of Reddit's biggest forums with over 14 million subscribers. “Bots on Reddit are overwhelmingly used for simple advertising purposes, not political manipulation like everyone likes to claim. Most things advertised by these bot accounts are adult oriented: marijuana/Delta8 ads, porn, gambling, or they're sold or operated to mass-advertise drop shipped goods, most of which are credit-card skimming scams or deliver different goods than ordered or never deliver at all.”In addition to r/AskHistorians, subs including r/AskPhilosophy, r/AskEconomics, and r/Cybersecurity said that they were experiencing problems with ChatGPT, but at a manageable frequency right now. “ChatGPT has a style that's fairly easy to identify, but the real test is the quality, and it appears that ChatGPT is very bad at philosophy,” said a moderator from AskPhilosophy. But with regards to the bot attack, “It's only a matter of time before someone else tries it, and presumably they're going to get better at evading our quality control efforts,” says the AskPhilosophy moderator. They believe ChatGPT comments have now become relatively uncommon on the forum. “Either that, or they're getting better at fooling us.”A r/Cybersecurity moderator says the sub has a good detection rate for catching ChatGPT content when it’s used explicitly for marketing. However, karma farming, where fake accounts masquerade as real ones, presents a trickier issue. “User reports will occasionally catch these, but our own moderation tools are frankly useless, and we have no idea what percentage of inauthentic content we're catching in this category currently,” they said. As a result, “Our problem isn't necessarily ‘what we've found so far’ but ‘what we've missed’.” Regardless of whether it’s a serious issue right now, most subs are bracing themselves for the future – especially if large language models like GPT-4 get better at crafting human-sounding content.A study of OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-2 XL found humans struggled to reliably spot AI-produced text. The study was carried out before the onset of the current generative AI hype, and most people weren’t sure how to identify AI. “Machine generated text tends to be very fluent, very grammatical and very coherent, but […] it gets sidetracked easily and says a lot of irrelevant things,” said Liam Dugan, a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania and the paper’s lead author. “Humans go into [an AI-text detection task] expecting surface level errors and misspellings or ungrammatical sentences, where in actuality, what they really should be looking for is, is this factual? Is this common sense? Is this relevant to what the post was talking about?”  Tools like GPTZero analyze text to predict whether it was written by a large language model, but they’re not infallible when it comes to detecting AI-produced content. To complicate matters, two recent papers show that using paraphrasing models that jumble up ChatGPT-generated text significantly undermines today’s AI text detectors. Reddit is working on AI-detection tools for forums that want to root out this kind of content, a Reddit employee told Gilbert and the rest of the team.For now though, the job is falling mostly to moderators. “It's going to require a lot of human labor, which is no fun,” said Gilbert. “We all do this as a volunteer activity.” But Reddit, along with other social media platforms, has a huge incentive to get a handle on this now, before the problem gets worse. “They want people to read their ads, right?” pointed out Gilbert. “It’s not like [Google’s AI chatbot] Bard is going to buy anything.” Whether the problem can be fought in a meaningful way might be decisive in whether social media continues to exist in its current form. “I think a lot of claims about ‘GPT will revolutionize [whatever]’ are bullshit,” said the r/Cybersecurity moderator, “but I'd bet the farm that traditional social media has a finite lifespan, largely because inauthentic content is becoming so realistic and cheap to make that we're going to struggle to find who's real and who's a bot.”By signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content."
12p7e9m,anime_titties,European privacy watchdog creates ChatGPT task force,,cambeiu,1824,134,https://redd.it/12p7e9m,2023-04-17 10:00:39,"[1/2] A response in Chinese by ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, is seen on its website in this illustration picture taken February 9, 2023. REUTERS/Florence Lo/IllustrationBRUSSELS, April 13 (Reuters) - The body that unites Europe's national privacy watchdogs said on Thursday it had set up a task force on ChatGPT, a potentially important first step toward a common policy on setting privacy rules on artificial intelligence.The move by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) follows a unilateral move by Italy last month to curb ChatGPT - a stance that Germany's commissioner for data protection said could be followed in Europe's biggest economy. Spain's AEPD watchdog said on Thursday that it too would launch a preliminary investigation into potential data breaches by ChatGPT.ChatGPT, an AI program that grabbed the public's attention for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries, has grown to be the fastest-growing consumer application in history with more than 100 million monthly active users, while raising questions about threats it may pose to safety, privacy and jobs.Experts, U.S. government and several other European governments have also expressed concern about the rapid growth of adoption of ChatGPT and similar AI products.""The EDPB members discussed the recent enforcement action undertaken by the Italian data protection authority against OpenAI about the Chat GPT service,"" the statement said.""The EDPB decided to launch a dedicated task force to foster cooperation and to exchange information on possible enforcement actions conducted by data protection authorities.""A source at one national watchdog who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media said member states hoped to align their policy positions but this would take time.The source said member states were not seeking to punish or make rules that will affect Microsoft Corp-backed (MSFT.O) ChatGPT owner OpenAI, but rather to create general policies that ""are transparent.""They said attendees at Thursday's meeting included policy experts who presented opinions and exchanged ideas, rather than being decision makers.The EDPB is an independent body that oversees data protection rules in the European Union, and it is composed of national data protection watchdogs.The organization could not immediately be reached for comment.The discussion of ChatGPT was added to the body's agenda following a request from Spain to discuss the matter earlier this week.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

10zndr5,Futurology,"Google, Microsoft ChatGPT Clones Will Destroy Internet Search",,Willheimer,15315,2246,https://redd.it/10zndr5,2023-02-11 14:15:05,"Jump toSure, Google's answer to ChatGPT will save you time. But it'll also lie to you.
This week Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, announced that his company's internet search engine — the way the vast majority of humans interact with a near-total corpus of human knowledge — is about to change. Enter a query, and you'll get more than pages and pages of links, along with a few suggested answers. Now you'll get an assist from artificial intelligence.""Soon,"" a Google blog post under Pichai's byline declared, ""you'll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web."" A chatbot named Bard will deliver search results in complete sentences, as a human might.A day later Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, announced that his company's competing search engine, Bing, will do the same, using the tech behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT. No search engine has ever really challenged Google's hold on the world's questions; Microsoft sees AI as its chance to come at the king.These new chatbots aren't actually intelligent. The tech behind the scenes is called a large language model, a hunk of software that can extract words related to each other from a huge database and produce sophisticated writing and visual art based on minimal prompting. But when it comes to the acquisition, classification, and retrieval of knowledge, this approach is the subject of an old fight. It's been brewing since at least the early 2000s — and maybe since the 0s, at the Library of Alexandria. Fundamentally, it's a debate about the best way to know stuff. Do we engage with the complexity of competing information? Or do we let an authority reduce everything to a simple answer? Bard has a simple answer for that age-old question. From now on, instead of showing you a dozen webpages with instructions for opening a can of beans, machine-learning droids will just tell you how to open one. And if you believe that effective search is what made the internet the most important technology of the 20th and 21st centuries, then that seemingly simple change should give you the shakes. The collateral damage in this war of the machines could be nothing less than the obliteration of useful online information forever.Sometimes a simple answer is fine. In what the trade calls a ""known-item search,"" we just want a factual response to a specific question. What's the most popular dog breed? How old is Madonna? Google is great at that stuff.The other kind of search — ""exploratory search"" — is the hard one. That's where you don't know what you don't know. What's the right phone for me? What's the deal with the Thirty Years' War? Getting a satisfactory answer is more iterative. You throw a bunch of keywords into the search box, you scroll through the links, you try new terms. It's not perfect, and it's skewed by the profit motives of advertisers and the implicit judgments that Google makes behind the scenes about which pages count as authoritative. But it's what made it possible for us to find a needle in an online haystack.Then came ChatGPT. As Google's vice president of search told me a year ago, when I wrote an article about why online search sucks, the company was already using artificial intelligence to make its search bar better at understanding what we seekers of knowledge really meant. But the seemingly overnight success of ChatGPT left Google scrambling to bring online a bot of its own that could answer back. Google has been dreaming of this particular electric sheep for a long time. At a conference in 2011, its chairman at the time, Eric Schmidt, declared that search's endgame was to use AI to ""literally compute the right answer"" to queries rather than identify relevant pages. A 2021 paper from Google Research lays out that aspiration in much more detail. ""The original vision of question answering,"" the authors write, ""was to provide human-quality responses (i.e., ask a question using natural language and get an answer in natural language). Question answering systems have only delivered on the question part."" Language-model chatbots might be able to provide more humanlike answers than regular old search, they added, but there was one problem: ""Such models are dilettantes."" Meaning they don't have ""a true understanding of the world,"" and they're ""incapable of justifying their utterances by referring to supporting documents in the corpus they were trained over."" To make an AI chatbot effective at search, the paper concludes, you'd have to build in more authority and transparency. You'd have to somehow remove bias from its training database, and you'd have to teach it to incorporate diverse perspectives. Pull off that hat trick inside a backflip, and you'd transform the bot from a dilettante to a reasonable facsimile of a ""domain expert."" I talked to a bunch of non-Google computer scientists about the state of internet search for my story last year, and all of them said the same thing about this idea: Don't do it.For one thing, chatbots lie. Not on purpose! It's just that they don't understand what they're saying. They're just recapitulating things they've absorbed elsewhere. And sometimes that stuff is wrong. Researchers describe this as a tendency to ""hallucinate"" — ""producing highly pathological translations that are completely untethered from the source material."" Chatbots, they warn, are inordinately vulnerable to regurgitating racism, misogyny, conspiracy theories, and lies with as much confidence as the truth.That's why we, the searchers, are a crucial component of the search process. Over years of exploring the digital world, we've all gotten better at spotting misinformation and disinformation. You know what I mean. When you're scrolling through the links in a Google search, looking for ""esoteric shit,"" as one search expert calls it, you see some pages that just look dodgy, maybe in ways you can't even totally articulate. You skim past those and open the legit-looking ones in new tabs.Conversational answers generated automatically by chatbots will pretty much eliminate that human element of bullshit detection. Look at it this way: If you're the kind of person who reads this kind of article, you're trained to think that a halfway decent bit of writing signifies a modicum of competency and expertise. Links to sources or quotes from experts indicate viable research and confirmed facts. But search chatbots can fake all that. They'll elide the sources they're drawing on, and the biases built into their databases, behind the trappings of acceptable, almost-but-not-quite-human-sounding prose. However wrong they are, they'll sound right. We won't be able to tell if they're hallucinating. An early example of what we're in for: A wag on Mastodon who has been challenging chatbots asked a demo of a Microsoft model trained on bioscience literature whether the antiparasitic drug ivermectin is effective in the treatment of COVID-19. It simply answered ""yes."" (Ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19.) And that was a known-item search! The wag was looking for a simple fact. The chatbot gave him a nonfact and served it up as the truth.Sure, an early demo of Bing's new search bot provides traditional links-'n'-boxes results along with the AI's response. And it's possible that Google and Microsoft will eventually figure out how to make their bots better at separating fact from fiction, so you won't feel the need to check their work. But if algorithms were any good at spotting misinformation, then QAnon and vaccine deniers and maybe even Donald Trump wouldn't be a thing — or, at least, not as much of a thing. When it comes to search, AI isn't going to be a lie detector. It's going to be a very authoritative and friendly-sounding bullshit spreader.In his blog post, Pichai says conversational responses to complex queries are easier to understand than a long list of links. They're certainly faster to read — no more of that pesky scrolling and clicking. But even though a chatbot will presumably be drawing on the same sources as a traditional search engine, its answers are more likely to be oversimplifications. The risk is that search results will from now on be tales programmed by idiots, full of sound and vocabulary but with answers signifying nothing. That's not a result. It's spam.But the really dangerous part is that the chatbot's conversational answers will obliterate a core element of human understanding. Citations — a bibliography, a record of your footsteps through an intellectual forest — are the connective tissue of inquiry. They're not just about the establishment of provenance. They're a map of replicable pathways for ideas, the ligaments that turn information into knowledge. There's a reason it's called a train of thought; insights come from attaching ideas to each other and taking them out for a spin. That's what an exploratory search is all about: figuring out what you need to know as you learn it. Hide those pathways, and there's no way to know how a chatbot knows what it knows, which means there's no way to assess its answer.""In many situations there is no one answer. There is no easy answer. You have to let people discover their own answers,"" Chirag Shah, an information scientist at the University of Washington, told me last year. ""Now we have the technical abilities to build a large language model that can capture basically all of human knowledge. Let's say we could do that. The question is, would you then use it to answer all the questions? Even the questions that are not factual? It's one thing to ask when Labor Day is, or the next full solar eclipse. It's another to ask, should Russia have invaded Ukraine?""Complex subjects and ideas with multiple facets and arguments don't lend themselves to one-and-done answers. What you want is to click on the links, to follow your nose. That's how people turn existing information and art into something new, through innovation and synthesis. And that's exactly what chatbot search will not favor. Worst case, you won't be able to know anything outside what an opaque algorithm thinks is most relevant — factual or not.Microsoft's bot already shows its work. Presumably Google is also working on that. But honestly, it might not be much of a priority. ""They want to keep things as simple and easy as possible for their end users,"" Shah observes. ""That allows them to intertwine more ads in the same display and to optimize on whatever metrics they want in terms of ranking. But we already know that these things are not purely ranked on relevance. They're ranked on engagement. People don't just click and share things that are factually or authoritatively correct.""Google and Bing, after all, are businesses. The chatbots answering our search terms can't be honest information brokers, not just because they're dumbasses, but because an honest information broker won't sell as many ads or amp up engagement. Google's search pages already aren't fully trustworthy — they overindex YouTube video results, for example, because YouTube is a subsidiary of Google. If the best instructional video for how to paint tabletop-game minifigures is on Vimeo? Tough.So imagine the kind of hallucinations a large language model like Bard will have if, in addition to misreading its own sources, it's programmed to favor engagement. It'll push the stuff that keeps us meatbags clicking. And as the past few years of social media have shown, that's rarely the truth. If a search engine offers only easy answers, no one will be able to ask hard questions.Adam Rogers is a senior correspondent at Insider.

12m5um2,technology,"‘Overemployed’ Hustlers Exploit ChatGPT To Take On Even More Full-Time Jobs - ""ChatGPT does like 80 percent of my job,"" said one worker. Another is holding the line at four robot-performed jobs. ""Five would be overkill,""",,speckz,10254,1223,https://redd.it/12m5um2,2023-04-14 19:54:29,"About a year ago, Ben found out that one of his friends had quietly started to work multiple jobs at the same time. The idea had become popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, when working from home became normalized, making the scheme easier to pull off. A community of multi-job hustlers, in fact, had come together online, referring to themselves as the “overemployed.” The idea excited Ben, who lives in Toronto and asked that Motherboard not use his real name, but he didn’t think it was possible for someone like him to pull it off. He helps financial technology companies market new products; the job involves creating reports, storyboards, and presentations, all of which involve writing. There was “no way,” he said, that he could have done his job two times over on his own. Then, last year, he started to hear more and more about ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by the research lab OpenAI. Soon enough, he was trying to figure out how to use it to do his job faster and more efficiently, and what had been a time-consuming job became much easier. (""Not a little bit more easy,” he said, “like, way easier."") That alone didn’t make him unique in the marketing world. Everyone he knew was using ChatGPT at work, he said. But he started to wonder whether he could pull off a second job. Then, this year, he took the plunge, a decision he attributes to his new favorite online robot toy. How are people you know using ChatGPT at work? We want to hear from you. From a non-work device, contact our reporter at maxwell.strachan@vice.com or via Signal at 310-614-3752 for extra security.“That's the only reason I got my job this year,” Ben said of OpenAI's tool. “ChatGPT does like 80 percent of my job if I’m being honest.” He even used it to generate cover letters to apply for jobs.Over the last few months, the exploding popularity of ChatGPT and similar products has led to growing concerns about AI’s potential effects on the international job market—specifically, the percentage of jobs that could be automated away, replaced by a well-oiled army of chatbots. But for a small cohort of fast-thinking and occasionally devious go-getters, AI technology has turned into an opportunity not to be feared but exploited, with their employers apparently none the wiser. The people Motherboard spoke with for this article requested anonymity to avoid losing their jobs. For clarity, Motherboard in some cases assigned people aliases in order to differentiate them, though we verified each of their identities. Some, like Ben, were drawn into the overemployed community as a result of ChatGPT. Others who were already working multiple jobs have used recent advancements in AI to turbocharge their situation, like one Ohio-based technology worker who upped his number of jobs from two to four after he started to integrate ChatGPT into his work process. “I think five would probably just be overkill,” he said. Throughout the overemployed community, there is a quiet arms race to figure out just how much of the corporate workday can be automated away using an assortment of AI tools, some of which predate ChatGPT. The possibility of increasing their income, or at least easing the burden of holding down multiple jobs, has led to an explosion of experimentation.When one of Ben’s bosses, for example, now asks him to create a story for an upcoming product release, he will explain the context and provide a template to ChatGPT, which then creates an outline for him and helps fill out the sections. The AI chatbot knows Ben’s title and the parameters of his duties and has become even better at understanding the context since the launch of GPT-4, the latest edition, he said. “I can just tell it to create a story,” said Ben, “and it just does it for me, based off the context that I gave it.” Ben still needs to verify the information—”sometimes it gets stuff wrong, which is totally normal,” he said—but the adjustments are relatively “minor” and easy to fix. Occasionally, he even asks ChatGPT to craft responses to Slack messages from his manager. In such cases, he requests that ChatGPT write the message in all lowercase, so that it appears more organic to the boss.  Another overemployed worker also told me they have started using ChatGPT to transcribe Zoom meetings so they can be largely ignored in the moment and referenced later.Charles, who has worked as a software engineer and product manager and solutions architect, including at a FAANG company, had been all-in on overemployment since 2020—while he currently works two jobs, he worked four at the height of the pandemic—but said that AI tools have made juggling the positions much easier. At the FAANG company, he was able to outsource written tasks to AI tools, like writing a memo to defend and justify a business decision. In such a case, he’d input the relevant facts and parameters into an AI chatbot, which would cohesively lay them out more quickly than he ever could. Additionally, he’d use it to lay out directions for engineers (“It allows you to take, basically, a sentence and expand it out into a paragraph”); and create a “foundation” when coding. The ChatGPT-created code “oftentimes” would work perfectly, he said, but the errors could be identified and resolved easily enough, he said. One member of the overemployed, who, unusually, works three financial reporting jobs, said he’s found ChatGPT useful in the creation of macros in Excel. “I can create macros, but it takes me an hour, two hours, plus, to write the code, test it, make sure everything's working,” he said. By comparison, with ChatGPT, he can provide the parameters and it’ll “spit something out” that he can update and tweak to his specifications. The process can allow him to cram what is traditionally a “two-week long process” into a few hours.  (He says he avoids providing ChatGPT with confidential information.)Daniel, a staff engineer on the East Coast who works one director-level position and another as a senior dev (one job is on Pacific time and one is in the United Kingdom), similarly said that ChatGPT’s code can leave something to be desired, but said it’s been useful when it comes to writing emails. “Most people in tech probably aren't as good at writing things as most other people,” Daniel said. He included himself in that critique of his own industry, but said it’s no longer a problem, as he can plug the key points into ChatGPT and ask the AI assistant to rewrite it “in a more professional way,” he said. “It's really good for stuff like that.”Excitement for the potential of ChatGPT isn’t limited to the technology and financial spheres of the overemployed community. Marshall, a university lecturer in the United Kingdom who secretly runs a digital marketing agency and tech startup on the side, has become a ChatGPT fanatic since its release. (During class, he often has students run through exercises, during which time he is often able to open up his laptop and work on his side hustles.) “It’s the best assistant ever,” he told me excitedly.Marshall has come to see himself as the idea man, and ChatGPT as the labor. “I'm quite a conceptualizing person. So I'm quite happy for my brain to do that. But the first draft of anything almost always goes through GPT,” he said.  Already, the chatbot has helped him generate business plans, internal system documents, blog posts, and Excel spreadsheets. He estimated that ChatGPT can often pull off 80 percent of the legwork, leaving him to handle the final 20 percent.  The tool has even helped him win a grant from the U.K. government (the application was “50-50 me and ChatGPT,” he said) and complete coursework for a master’s degree necessary to receive a university teaching qualification he was too busy to handle by himself while working three jobs.The members of the overemployed community know that what they’re doing is frowned on by corporate leaders. But that doesn’t mean they think what they are doing is amoral. “I never could mentally comprehend why it was so taboo for me to work two salaried positions,” said the Ohio-based technology worker. “There's plenty of people I've known in my personal life who have worked at Walmart from 4 a.m. to 2 p.m., and then gone and worked another job.” The financial professional similarly said he started working multiple jobs because he doesn't trust that working as hard as he can at a single job will be “rewarded with more pay,” just “more work.” By taking on more jobs, he can do more work but also “get paid for it,” he said. More than a member of the overemployed community, Charles, the FAANG alumni, considers himself part of the FIRE movement—short for “Financial Independence, Retire Early” Not yet 30, he is already making $500,000 working two jobs and worth around $3 million, claims he backed up to Motherboard with documentation. But he hopes to increase his compensation to $800,000 by tacking on a third position, and reach a net worth of $10 million by 35.Even though he is already using ChatGPT to work multiple jobs, Charles still is trying to figure out ways to make his dream even easier to obtain. When we spoke he said he’s already been “able to outsource” coding tasks to a third party in the past, and that he has been hard at work trying to develop a way to have someone else mimic both his voice and image on a computer screen. Once he can do so, he said, he hopes to offshore his job to someone in India who can “do my job for me.” In such moments, it can feel like the AI-infused overemployed community is taking advantage of a brief moment in time, when the tools that can be used to automate a job are much better understood by the workforce than the bosses with hiring and firing ability. One person, who works multiple jobs in information technology, spoke openly about the tension that created: People can more easily hold down multiple jobs today; but, should the bosses realize just how much their jobs can be handled by robots, they could be at risk of their jobs being automated away. As a result, he said, there’s good reason to keep quiet about what they’ve discovered.Most of the overemployed workers themselves maintain that their jobs require a baseline level of expertise, even with ChatGPT. Still, some members of the overemployed community feel they have peered into the future, and not liked everything they’ve seen.One such person is Ryan, who works multiple jobs in data analytics and marketing in a large Midwestern city. Over the last year, he has watched in astonishment as ChatGPT figured out a way to automate an ever-growing percentage of his job, including writing ad copy and blog posts. The feat can feel exciting, and it has temporarily made his job easier.  “I can crank out a blog post in, you know, 45 minutes now, as opposed to three hours. It's insane,” he said. But Ryan does worry. At times, he said, he could not help but feel that the entrance of ChatGPT into the marketing sector felt like the insertion of the modern loom into the textile industry. “It's gonna be one loom operator, as opposed to, you know, 100 weavers,” he said.By signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content."
10jq6yr,technology,ChatGPT passes MBA exam given by a Wharton professor.,,SUPRVLLAN,33066,2178,https://redd.it/10jq6yr,2023-01-23 23:55:53,"ProfileSectionstvFeaturedMore From NBCFollow NBC NewsNew research conducted by a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School found that the artificial intelligence-driven chatbot GPT-3 was able to pass the final exam for the school's Master of Business Administration (MBA) program.Professor Christian Terwiesch, who authored the research paper ""Would Chat GPT3 Get a Wharton MBA? A Prediction Based on Its Performance in the Operations Management Course,"" said that the bot scored between a B- and B on the exam. The bot's score, Terwiesch wrote, shows its ""remarkable ability to automate some of the skills of highly compensated knowledge workers in general and specifically the knowledge workers in the jobs held by MBA graduates including analysts, managers, and consultants.""The bot did an ""amazing job at basic operations management and process analysis questions including those that are based on case studies,"" Terwiesch wrote in the paper, which was published on Jan. 17. He also said the bot's explanations were ""excellent."" The bot is also ""remarkably good at modifying its answers in response to human hints,"" he concluded.Terwiesch’s findings come as educators become increasingly concerned that AI chatbots could inspire cheating. Although chatbots are not a new technology, ChatGPT exploded on social media in late 2022. Earlier this month, New York City’s Department of Education announced a ban on ChatGPT from its schools’ devices and networks.Much of the debate is centered around ChatGPT’s conversational speaking style and coherent, topical response style, which makes it difficult to distinguish from human responses. Experts who work in both artificial intelligence and education have acknowledged that bots like ChatGPT could be a detriment to education in the future. But in recent interviews, some educators and experts they weren’t concerned — yet. A spokesperson for artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, which created the bot, declined to comment.The GPT-3 model used in the experiment appears to be an older sibling of the most recent ChatGPT bot that has become a controversial topic among educators and those who work in the field of AI. ChatGPT, the newest version, “is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series,” according to OpenAI’s website.While Chat GPT3's results were impressive, Terwiesch noted that Chat GPT3 “at times makes surprising mistakes in relatively simple calculations at the level of 6th grade Math.” The present version of Chat GPT is “not capable of handling more advanced process analysis questions, even when they are based on fairly standard templates,"" Terwiesch added. ""This includes process flows with multiple products and problems with stochastic effects such as demand variability.”Still, Terwiesch said ChatGPT3’s performance on the test has “important implications for business school education, including the need for exam policies, curriculum design focusing on collaboration between human and AI, opportunities to simulate real world decision making processes, the need to teach creative problem solving, improved teaching productivity, and more.”After publishing his paper, Terwiesch told NBC News that he’s become more aware of the debate around the chat bot and the subsequent conversation surrounding whether it should be banned.He believes there's a way to marry education and AI to enhance learning for his students. ""I think the technology can engage students in other forms others than the good old, 'write a five-page essay,'"" he said. ""But that is up to us as educators to reimagine education and find other ways of engaging the students.""Kalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Congressional offices have begun using OpenAI’s popular and controversial generative AI tool ChatGPT to experiment with the technology internally, a senior official within the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer’s House Digital Services said Friday.The House recently created a new AI working group for staff to test and share new AI tools in the congressional office environment and now the House of Representatives‘ digital service has obtained 40 licenses for ChatGPT Plus, which were distributed earlier this month.The purchase of the licenses comes amid widespread debate over how artificial intelligence technology should be used and regulated across the private sector and within government. This represents one of the earliest examples of ChatGPT being used as part of the policymaking process.The 40 licenses were assigned on a first-come first-served basis, and House Digital Services will pay the $20/month per office subscription plan for an indefinite period of time, according to the official. Details of which Congressional offices have received the ChatGPT Plus licenses will remain anonymous for now. ChatGPT Plus is a new subscription plan rolled out by OpenAI in February that allows subscribers to avoid getting bumped out of the chatbot during peak usage hours and receive faster responses.“Oftentimes members are experimenting with things, new tools, in their own ways  and we just want to be in the loop on that. We want to help facilitate that experimentation,” the official said.They added: “There are so many different use cases for ChatGPT but what we’ve heard is at the top of the list for Congressional offices is creating and summarizing content.”The chatbot won’t be able to run within the House of Representatives’ internal server, which has a firewall that will block it. Staff have also been advised not to use the tool to run queries using Congressional data or other sensitive internal information. Additionally, the OpenAI tool can’t be used to download code onto Congressional devices but can be used within a web browser or Application Programming Interface (API) for requests.According a recent AI Working Group internal email obtained by FedScoop, the AI tool is expected to be used for many day to day tasks and key responsibilities within congressional offices such as: generating constituent response drafts and press documents; summarizing large amounts of text in speeches; drafting policy papers or even bills; creating new logos or graphical element for branded office resources and more.“This is the House getting ahead of the curve to address emerging technology that could really help Congress better serve the public,” said Daniel Schuman, co-founder of the Congressional Data Coalition and policy director at the Demand Progress advocacy group. “Everything from making it easier to come with ideas, to summarizing information, to draft letters or documents and handle some aspects of constituent engagement. Ultimately it will allow Congressional staff to scale up more quickly regarding the demands placed on them,” said Schuman, who has played a key role in drafting and enacting tech and accountability related legislation in Congress including the DATA Act, FOIA modernization, and dozens of House rules changes.The House Digital Services team was launched in the summer of 2022 with a wide-ranging remit to improve user experience in Congress and expand the ability of lawmakers to interact with their constituents. The team is tasked with building intuitive solutions that improve on member offices’ most significant challenges. It comes after nonprofit groups, like TechCongress and others, have for years looked to inject tech talent into Congress through digital service fellowships.News that lawmakers are experimenting with generative AI comes as federal government agencies work to establish new norms governing use of the technology. Last month, National Science Foundation Chief Information Officer Dorothy Aronson said her agency was beginning to experiment internally with appropriate use cases for such tech and to build safe guardrails for its use."

This month saw the surprise dissolution of Microsoft’s entire Ethics & Society team—the latest casualty in the company’s ongoing layoffs affecting 10,000 employees, or roughly 5 percent of its entire global workforce. As first reported by The Verge on Monday, the news allegedly came after Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI assured remaining employees that their jobs were safe. Once a 30-member department, the Ethics & Society team had been reduced to just seven people in October 2022 following an internal reorganization.The move strikes many experts as worrisome, especially now—Microsoft’s Ethics & Society department was responsible for ensuring the company’s principles pertaining to artificial intelligence development were reflected in product designs. Most recently, The Verge explained the group worked to identify risks within the company’s plans to rapidly integrate OpenAI’s tech into its product suite. Microsoft has so far invested over $11 billion in the AI startup.[Related: No, the AI chatbots (still) aren’t sentient.]Amid the multiple waves of dramatic layoffs that have roiled Big Tech in recent months, Microsoft first announced plans in January to ax approximately 10,000 jobs from its global workforce by March 2023. The major cutback occurred as a new “AI arms race” kicked off between companies including Microsoft, Google, and Meta. All three and others are rushing to deliver on their lofty promises of chat programs, text generators, and revolutionary online search aids to consumers. Industry observers continue to urge caution against wantonly unleashing hastily tested, frequently problematic generative AI software.“I am concerned about the timing of this decision, given that Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI and is using ChatGPT in its search engine Bing and across other services,” Duri Long, an assistant professor in communications focusing on human/AI interaction at Northwestern University, writes to PopSci via email. “This technology is new, and we are still learning about its implications for society. In my opinion, dedicated ethics teams are vital to the responsible development of any technology, and especially so with AI.” Microsoft still maintains a separate Office of Responsible AI responsible for determining principles and guidelines to oversee artificial intelligence initiatives, but a gap remains between that segment of the company and how those plans are translated to their own projects. “People would look at the principles coming out of the office of responsible AI and say, ‘I don’t know how this applies,’” a former employee told The Verge. “Our job was to show them and to create rules in areas where there were none.”[Related: The FTC has its eyes on AI scammers.]“It’s not that [Ethics & Society] is going away—it’s that it’s evolving,” Microsoft’s corporate VP of AI reportedly assured remaining Ethics & Society members following the October 2022 reorg.  “It’s evolving toward putting more of the energy within the individual product teams that are building the services and the software, which does mean that the central hub that has been doing some of the work is devolving its abilities and responsibilities.”This article has been updated to include a quote from Duri Long.Like science, tech, and DIY projects?Sign up to receive Popular Science's emails and get the highlights.LinksFollow usDISCLAIMER(S)Articles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue of any purchases made.Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service.© 2023 Recurrent.

1275jd9,tech,"AI will eventually free people up to 'work when they want to,' ChatGPT investor predicts",,MichaelTen,1482,855,https://redd.it/1275jd9,2023-03-31 03:15:04,"Jump to
The future of artificial intelligence could ""free humanity from the need to work,"" according to Vinod Khosla, the cofounder of Sun Microsystems and an early investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. But it's a future that Khosla warns won't come without major disruption or global competition.In an interview with Semafor, the venture capitalist predicted that 80% of jobs could be completed by AI in 25 years. ""This large transformation is the opportunity to free humanity from the need to work. People will work when they want to work on what they want to work on,"" Khosla told Semafor.Khosla is the founder of VC firm Khosla Ventures, which has invested in companies including DoorDash, Instacart, Impossible Foods, Wattpad, and more. Back in 2014, Khosla told Semafor, he started thinking about a future with AI, even predicting that eventually most media would be created by AI in the future and that AI will disrupt teaching.Still, any transition to offloading most jobs to AI won't be seamless, Khosla said.""That's a utopian vision. But getting from here to that utopia is really disruptive and it is terrible to be the disrupted one,"" he said. ""So you have to have empathy for whoever's being disrupted. And the transition is very messy. It hurts people, hurts lives, destroys lives.""A spokesperson for Khosla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for any additional comment ahead of publication.A study from researchers with OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania found that AI tools, like ChatGPT, will likely impact up to 80% of the US workforce, reported Insider. AI jobs in tech, mathematics, accounting, and communication fields will be especially at risk, the researchers found. Goldman Sachs researchers recently estimated that 300 million full-time jobs across the globe could be disrupted by AI. The report also highlighted that US workers in legal and administrative positions are especially vulnerable. Khosla said more research is needed to aid in the advancement of the recent boom in AI — especially as more global powers race to gain the upper hand in AI. Khosla said there are some countries, citing Rwanda and Brazil, that may not be able to fund their own AI. That stands in contrast to China, he said, which has buckled down on AI with a five-year plan to dominate in this technology.

In the 10 or so days since its grand entrance, ChatGPT has been everywhere: littering Twitter feeds, cluttering promotional emails, igniting ethical debates in schools and newsrooms, infiltrating dinner table discussions—it’s inescapable and apparently already nestling its way into companies’ important business decisions.OpenAI launched ChatGPT toward the end of November, but the artificial intelligence chatbot had its stable release in early February. Earlier this month, job advice platform ResumeBuilder.com surveyed 1,000 business leaders who either use or plan to use ChatGPT. It found that nearly half of their companies have implemented the chatbot. And roughly half of this cohort say ChatGPT has already replaced workers at their companies.“There is a lot of excitement regarding the use of ChatGPT,” ResumeBuilder.com’s chief career advisor Stacie Haller says in a statement. “Since this new technology is just ramping up in the workplace, workers need to surely be thinking of how it may affect the responsibilities of their current job. The results of this survey show that employers are looking to streamline some job responsibilities using ChatGPT.”Business leaders already using ChatGPT told ResumeBuilder.com that their companies already use ChatGPT for a variety of reasons, including 66% for writing code, 58% for copywriting and content creation, 57% for customer support, and 52% for meeting summaries and other documents.In the hiring process, 77% of companies using ChatGPT say they use it to help write job descriptions, 66% to draft interview requisitions, and 65% to respond to applications. “Overall, most business leaders are impressed by ChatGPT’s work,” ResumeBuilder.com wrote in a news release. “Fifty-five percent say the quality of work produced by ChatGPT is ‘excellent,’ while 34% say it’s ‘very good.’”As gung ho as business leaders appear to be about the potential of ChatGPT, it’s not without its critiques, including concerns regarding cheating and plagiarism, racism and sexism bias, accuracy, and overall questions about how it’s been trained to learn. The Atlantic’s Ian Bogost warned it should be treated as a toy, not a tool, and New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose said that Microsoft’s new A.I. version of its Bing search engine powered by ChatGPT’s OpenAI left him feeling “deeply unsettled” and “even frightened” after a two-hour chat in which it sounded unhinged and somewhat dark.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously warned that ChatGPT shouldn’t be relied on for “anything important.” In a recent series of tweets he expressed concerns about the dangers posed by A.I. technology—and the iterations to follow—saying he worried how people of the future will view us.“Just as technology has evolved and replaced workers over the last several decades, ChatGPT may impact the way we work. As with all new technologies, companies’ use of ChatGPT will be continuously evolving, and we are only at the onset,” ResumeBuilder.com’s Haller says in a statement.“The economic model for using ChatGPT is also evolving,” she continues. “It will be interesting to see how this plays out in terms of savings as well as the reorg of certain jobs within the companies.”Nearly all of the companies using ChatGPT said they’ve saved money using the tool, with 48% saying they’ve saved more than $50,000 and 11% saying they’ve saved more than $100,000.Wherever the end is for companies’ usage of ChatGPT and other A.I. tools is, it’s certainly not in sight. Of the companies ResumeBuilder.com identified as businesses using the chatbot, 93% say they plan to expand their use of ChatGPT, and 90% of executives say ChatGPT experience is beneficial for job seekers—if it hasn’t already replaced their jobs.Learn how to navigate and strengthen trust in your business with The Trust Factor, a weekly newsletter examining what leaders need to succeed.

12ueuzz,technology,Who Asked for This: Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli Releases Medical ChatGPT Knockoff | Shkreli says his Dr. Gupta ChatGPT knockoff could one day replace all healthcare information. It currently seems like an ethical and privacy nightmare,,Hrmbee,4105,567,https://redd.it/12ueuzz,2023-04-21 21:11:31,"Disgraced Pharma Bro turned crypto shill Martin Shkreli is pivoting to a new venture: medical AI. Shkreli says his new medical chatbot called “Dr. Gupta” can answer a wide range of medical questions and could one day become a “replacement for all health care information.” Gizmodo tested Dr. Gupta, and while it definitely didn’t seem like a revolutionary tech by any stretch of the imagination, it did look like an inevitable ethical and privacy nightmare.Shkreli, who was released from prison last year after spending seven years behind bars for securities fraud, reveleaed his new AI tool on Twitter this week. During a Twitter Spaces event attended by Semafor, he claimed his new large language model was trained on data pulled from the web and online medical journals. The tech powering the AI is reportedly based on a modified version of OpenAI’s wildly popular ChatGPT. Dozens of other companies at this point, including Snap, have already released their own subject or industry-focused AI alternatives powered by ChatGPT. As for the name “Dr. Gupta,” that was reportedly picked because it includes the letters GPT. Yes, it’s dumb, but so are most of the other names for LLMs to this point. “WebMD is basically dead in the water,” Shkreli said, according to Semafor. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Caffeinate yourselfA whole array of Breville espresso machines—from manual to super-automatic—are on sale for 20% off.Dr. Gupta’s pitch is pretty simple: Ask it any medical information or advice and it will spit out an answer. Users can ask Gupta up to 5 free questions. After that, they will need to pay a $20 per month subscription to maintain access. The site uses a chatbot that will be familiar to anyone who’s played around with an LLM, but it also has a drop-down list of medical information where users can submit thier age, vitals, and, and lab test results in exchange for “more personalized and informative suggestions.”Gizmodo tested out Dr. Gupta using the free trial. Like many people this time of year, this writer was suffering from a particularly nasty case of seasonal allergies. After explaining my symptoms and asking Dr. Gupta for advice, I was immediately presented with a pop-up reading, “Dr. Gupta IS NOT a real physician.” The alert went on to say the tool was intended to serve as an alternative to a search engine and was “NOT” intended for medical or clinical uses. Further down the alert said Dr. Gupta “may provide potentially unreliable responses.” All very reassuring.After about 30 seconds, Gupta responded with a ChatGPT-styled response politely acknowledging my snotty suffering before recommending some basic over-the-counter antihistamines and nasal decongestants. Gupta went on to say it’s “essential” to clean my living space regularly, which admittedly hit pretty hard. I followed up by asking Gupta if it had any specific antihistamines recommendations and it said I should try Zyrtec or Claritin.Switching topics, I then asked Gupta whether or not it was safe to eat chicken that had been abandoned in the fridge for four days. Gupta responded by saying it’s generally safe to eat chicken that’s been in the fridge for up to four days but advised me to check for any nasty smell, mold or sliminess. In general, Gupta worked as intended in my extremely limited tests but really didn’t seem much different at all from ChatGPT. In the first case of allergies. It took longer to find those basic answers than it would have to search the same question on WebMD.It was only a matter of time before someone tried to modify ChatGPT for medical results. It’s a little ironic to say the least, though, that the person leading that charge is a disgraced pharmaceutical huckster once dubbed “the most hated man in America.” Shkreli earned that vaunted moniker after his pharmaceutical company at the time acquired the rights to a Parkinson’s treatment drug called Daraprim and quickly jacked up its price by more than 5,000% from $13.50 per dose to $750 for a pill. Shkreli pissed people off even more by spending $2 million to acquire a single copy 2015 Wu-Tang Clan record.Shkreli became the poster child for what many perceived as an unchecked, profiteering pharmaceutical industry, however, his 2017 arrest and subsequent seven-year prison actually came from unrelated securities fraud charges. Last year, a federal judge finally determined Shkreli had in fact violated antitrust rules when he attempted to maintain a monopoly over Daraprim. Shkreli was forced to pay $64.6 million and was barred from life from the drug industry.Since then Shkreli tried to briefly reinvent himself, like many do, as a Crypto Bro by starting Druglike, a company that claims to want to democratize the costs of drug discovery through decentralized computing. Less than a year out of jail, however, Shkreli is already back in regulators’ crosshairs with the FTC recently asking a federal judge to hold the Pharma Bro in contempt of court for failing to give them the info they needed to determine if he was indeed breaking back into the medical industry. Old habits, it seems, are hard to break.To put it mildly, there are a lot of potential problems with the Pharma Bro’s new AI adventure. For starters, its difficult to see how launching an AI tool giving medical advice and recommending certain drugs wouldn’t violate Shkreli’s drug industry ban. Then there’s the issue of accuracy. Disclaimer or not, Dr. Gupta could quickly run into some real problems recommending its users false or harmful informaiton. Large language models, including ChatGPT, are well known to “hallucinate” or basically make up answers to questions that could have no real basis in fact. That’s annoying when you ask it to create a cocktail, but its potentially life threatening if you ask it to tell you about a medical dose. Concerns over Gupta’s medical accuracy didn’t seem to bother Shkreli though.“How do you prevent a physician from doing the same?” he said on Twitter.Then there’s the issue of all that sensitive medical data Dr. Gupta is potentially gobbling up every time a user submits a query. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other regulatory protections place stricter regulations on how companies can use and share health data. Those restrictions could look like land mines Gupta will have to constantly struggle to dance around. Shkreli summed up his thinking on those concerns in a reply to a user on Twitter.“Read the terms”, Shkreli said. “If you don’t want to use it, do not use it!”"

12ppq16,GPT3,My teacher has falsely accused me of using ChatGPT to use an assignment.,"My highschool history teacher has accused me of using ChatGPT to complete an assignment.

(The authors say neither Microsoft nor OpenAI required any editorial oversight of the book, though Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into developing OpenAI's technologies.) In the book, Kohane says GPT-4, which was released in March 2023 to paying subscribers, answers US medical exam licensing questions correctly more than 90% of the time. It's a much better test-taker than previous ChatGPT AI models, GPT-3 and -3.5, and a better one than some licensed doctors, too. GPT-4 is not just a good test-taker and fact finder, though. It's also a great translator. In the book it's capable of translating discharge information for a patient who speaks Portuguese, and distilling wonky technical jargon into something 6th graders could easily read. As the authors explain with vivid examples, GPT-4 can also give doctors helpful suggestions about bedside manner, offering tips on how to talk to patients about their conditions in compassionate, clear language, and it can read lengthy reports or studies and summarize them in the blink of an eye. The tech can even explain its reasoning through problems in a way that requires some measure of what looks like human-style intelligence.But if you ask GPT-4 how it does all this, it will likely tell you that all of its intelligence is still ""limited to patterns in the data and does not involve true understanding or intentionality."" That's what GPT-4 told the authors of the book, when they asked it if it could actually engage in causal reasoning. Even with such limitations, as Kohane discovered in the book, GPT-4 can mimic how doctors diagnose conditions with stunning — albeit imperfect — success. Kohane goes through a clinical thought experiment with GPT-4 in the book, based on a real-life case that involved a newborn baby he treated several years earlier. Giving the bot a few key details about the baby he gathered from a physical exam, as well as some information from an ultrasound and hormone levels, the machine was able to correctly diagnose a 1 in 100,000 condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia ""just as I would, with all my years of study and experience,"" Kohane wrote.The doctor was both impressed and horrified. ""On the one hand, I was having a sophisticated medical conversation with a computational process,"" he wrote, ""on the other hand, just as mind blowing was the anxious realization that millions of families would soon have access to this impressive medical expertise, and I could not figure out how we could guarantee or certify that GPT-4's advice would be safe or effective."" GPT-4 isn't always reliable, and the book is filled with examples of its blunders. They range from simple clerical errors, like misstating a BMI that the bot had correctly calculated moments earlier, to math mistakes like inaccurately ""solving"" a Sudoku puzzle, or forgetting to square a term in an equation. The mistakes are often subtle, and the system has a tendency to assert it is right, even when challenged. It's not a stretch to imagine how a misplaced number or miscalculated weight could lead to serious errors in prescribing, or diagnosis. Like previous GPTs, GPT-4 can also ""hallucinate"" — the technical euphemism for when AI makes up answers, or disobeys requests.When asked about issue this by the authors of the book, GPT-4 said ""I do not intend to deceive or mislead anyone, but I sometimes make mistakes or assumptions based on incomplete or inaccurate data. I also do not have the clinical judgment or the ethical responsibility of a human doctor or nurse."" One potential cross-check the authors suggest in the book is to start a new session with GPT-4, and have it ""read over"" and ""verify"" its own work with a ""fresh set of eyes."" This tactic sometimes works to reveal mistakes — though GPT-4 is somewhat reticent to admit when it's been wrong. Another error-catching suggestion is to command the bot to show you its work, so you can verify it, human-style. It's clear that GPT-4 has the potential to free up precious time and resources in the clinic, allowing clinicians to be more present with patients, ""instead of their computer screens,"" the authors write. But, they say, ""we have to force ourselves to imagine a world with smarter and smarter machines, eventually perhaps surpassing human intelligence in almost every dimension. And then think very hard about how we want that world to work.""

    The buzzy AI chatbot just received a massive upgrade.
  If you ever tried asking ChatGPT about current events, you know the chatbot could only manage to spit out a limited set of answers, if at all. That's changing. On Thursday, the artificial intelligence company OpenAI announced that it's gradually rolling out plugins for ChatGPT, in a move that significantly expands the chatbot's functionality. The first wave of plugins, which are now available in alpha to select ChatGPT users and developers, allow ChatGPT to tap new sources of live data from the web, including third-party sources such as Expedia, Kayak and Instacart. This empowers ChatGPT to browse the web and execute tasks such as booking flights and even buying groceries, among many other tasks. Prior to this upgrade, ChatGPT was restricted to drawing information from its training data, which ran until 2021. ""Though not a perfect analogy, plugins can be 'eyes and ears' for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data,"" OpenAI said on its website. For instance, ChatGPT can now pull up answers to questions how the box office sales of this year's Oscar winners compare to those of other movies released recently. This new functionality is served up thanks to the browser plugin, which shows the sources the generative AI service is drawing information from before it spits out an answer.  ""Plugins are very experimental still but we think there's something great in this direction,"" OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman wrote in a tweet Thursday. ""It's been a heavily requested feature."" ChatGPT, which puts a conversational-style interface on top of an artificial intelligence construct known as a large language model, has been the buzz at the center of the tech world since it debuted in November. In the last several months, companies from Google and Microsoft to Adobe, Snapchat and Grammarly have rushed to show off and release similar generative AI capabilities in their own products.But there are marked imperfections in the results that services like ChatGPT produce. OpenAI's own research has shown that a chatbot with access to the internet is a risky prospect. For instance, it can have a tendency to quote unreliable sources or, as OpenAI points out, ""increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others."" Proponents of these AI services have been focusing on the benefits.A video posted to Twitter by OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman on Thursday demonstrates to how to use ChatGPT's Instacart plugin to assist with meal planning. The video shows ChatGPT recommending a chickpea salad recipe and then ultimately adds the required ingredients to Instacart for purchase with just a few prompts. We’ve added initial support for ChatGPT plugins — a protocol for developers to build tools for ChatGPT, with safety as a core design principle. Deploying iteratively (starting with a small number of users & developers) to learn from contact with reality: https://t.co/ySek2oevod pic.twitter.com/S61MTpddOVA video posted on Expedia's Twitter account shows how to leverage the Expedia plugin to essentially turn ChatGPT into your AI travel agent, helping travelers book flights and hotels. This is something ChatGPT previously couldn't do, although it could identify places and create an itinerary. ""You can install plugins to help with a wide variety of tasks. We are excited to see what developers create!""

12v4zlx,technology,AI is taking the jobs of Kenyans who write essays for U.S. college students - Ghostwriters say the meteoric rise of ChatGPT has coincided with a drop in income.,,speckz,1882,203,https://redd.it/12v4zlx,2023-04-22 14:48:59,"For the past nine years, Collins, a 27-year-old freelance writer, has been making money by writing assignments for students in the U.S. — over 13,500 kilometers away from Nanyuki in central Kenya, where he lives. He is part of the “contract cheating” industry, known locally as simply “academic writing.” Collins writes college essays on topics including psychology, sociology, and economics. Occasionally, he is even granted direct access to college portals, allowing him to submit tests and assignments, participate in group discussions, and talk to professors using students’ identities. In 2022, he made between $900 and $1,200 a month from this work.Lately, however, his earnings have dropped to $500–$800 a month. Collins links this to the meteoric rise of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence tools.“Last year at a time like this, I was getting, on average, 50 to 70 assignments, including discussions which are shorter, around 150 words each, and don’t require much research,” Collins told Rest of World. “Right now, on average, I get around 30 to 40-something assignments.” He requested to be identified only by his first name to avoid jeopardizing his accounts on platforms where he finds clients.In January 2023, online learning platform Study surveyed more than 1,000 American students and over 100 educators. More than 89% of the students said they had used ChatGPT for help with a homework assignment. Nearly half admitted to using ChatGPT for an at-home test or quiz, 53% had used it to write an essay, and 22% had used it for outlining one.Collins now fears that the rise of AI could significantly reduce students’ reliance on freelancers like him in the long term, affecting their income. Meanwhile, he depends on ChatGPT to generate the content he used to outsource to other freelance writers.While 17 states in the U.S. have banned contract cheating, it has not been a problem for freelancers in Kenya, concerned about providing for themselves and their families. Despite being the largest economy in East Africa, Kenya has the region’s highest unemployment rate, with 5.7% of the labor force out of work in 2021. Around 25.8% of the population is estimated to live in extreme poverty. This situation makes the country a potent hub for freelance workers. According to the Online Labour Index (OLI), an economic indicator that measures the global online gig economy, Kenya accounts for 1% of the world’s online freelance workforce, ranking 15th overall and second only to Egypt in Africa. About 70% of online freelancers in Kenya offer writing and translation services.John Kamau, who has offered contract cheating services since 2014, disagrees with Collins’ assessment. “Work will still be there because even editing the AI-generated text to avoid detection takes a lot of time and effort,” he told Rest of World. “So, I don’t think it’s as simple as saying, with AI, students in the U.S. will just do [the assignments] themselves.” Kamau, who doubles as a sales agent with a Nairobi-based construction supplies company, expects more schools will limit and block the use of tools like ChatGPT as AI tech improves. “Academic writers will still have their work. But it will have a positive effect [on] writers who can collaborate with ChatGPT and use it as a guide,” he said.Alfred Ongere, founder of consulting company AI Kenya, told Rest of World that the rise of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT will disrupt the supply of academic writers in Kenya. “On one hand, writers and other freelancers have realized the powerful capabilities of LLMs such as ChatGPT, and are using them in their work,” he said. “This means they can now spend more time being creative, and have better articles because of the time ChatGPT saves them. On the negative side, this will mean [fewer] jobs as their clients and origin of supply shift to ChatGPT and other AI tools to have their work done.” So far, higher education institutions in the U.S. have avoided outright bans on the use of ChatGPT. Instead, colleges, including Yale University, have issued guidelines and recommendations for staff on the use of AI, leaving it to teachers to decide how ChatGPT will be used in their classes.“The most I made in a month last year was $296. In March, I could barely get 10 assignments … I didn’t even hit $74.”Wade Brian, a third-year finance student, provides contract cheating services on the side. He told Rest of World he does not use ChatGPT to write entire essays, as that might cost him his credibility — and future assignments. Instead, he restricts its use to sourcing content, much like Google.  Brian agrees that lately, work has been slow. “When I started last year, as a literal amateur, in the first month, I did 30 assignments,” he said. “As I got better, I was doing up to 60 assignments a month. The most I made in a month last year was 40,000 Kenyan shillings [$296].” In March, Brian got barely 10 assignments. “It’s not that I haven’t been looking [for gigs]. I didn’t even hit 10,000 Kenyan shillings [$74],” he said. The rise of generative AI tools has made the work of educators harder. Christopher Kanan, an associate professor in the department of computer science at the University of Rochester, has started giving in-person, in-class quizzes due to the popularity of ChatGPT.“It just becomes harder to sort out who knows what and who’s getting help from things like ChatGPT,” he explained on the university’s website, even as he made it clear that AI tools are not going anywhere and would rapidly evolve.Others, like Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, have chosen to take a more open approach to ChatGPT in class. “The truth is, I probably couldn’t have stopped them even if I didn’t require it,” he told NPR.Meanwhile, the freelancers in Kenya who help American students cheat now compete for a smaller portion of the pie.“The first quarter of the year used to be part of the high season because students are back in college for their semesters, and they have a lot of assignments,” Adrian Nyanga, a freelancer who’s been in the industry for four years, told Rest of World.“But I’ve seen a dip in the assignments available this year, so there are no longer high and low seasons. It’s bad,” he said. “Remember, there are so many writers who have joined the industry in the past few years, and it was already getting harder to get gigs, but there are even fewer now, especially with AI.”"

12j5fbq,technology,"‘Thirsty’ AI: Training ChatGPT Required Enough Water to Fill a Nuclear Reactor’s Cooling Tower, Study Finds | An average user’s conversational exchange with ChatGPT amounts to dumping a large bottle of fresh water out on the ground, new research says.",,chrisdh79,335,183,https://redd.it/12j5fbq,2023-04-12 03:35:50,"Popular large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard are energy intensive, requiring massive server farms to provide enough data to train the powerful programs. Cooling those same data centers also makes the AI chatbots incredibly thirsty. New research suggests training for GPT-3 alone consumed 185,000 gallons (700,000 liters) of water. An average user’s conversational exchange with ChatGPT basically amounts to dumping a large bottle of fresh water out on the ground, according to the new study. Given the chatbot’s unprecedented popularity, researchers fear all those spilled bottles could take a troubling toll on water supplies, especially amid historic droughts and looming environmental uncertainty in the US.Researchers from the University of Colorado Riverside and the University of Texas Arlington published the AI water consumption estimates in a pre-print paper titled “Making AI Less ‘Thirsty.’” The authors found the amount of clear freshwater required to train GPT-3 is equivalent to the amount needed to fill a nuclear reactor’s cooling tower. OpenAI has not disclosed the length of time required to train GPT-3, complicating the researchers’ estimations, but Microsoft, which has struck a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar partnership with the AI startup and built supercomputers for AI training, says that its latest supercomputer, which would require an extensive cooling apparatus, contains 10,000 graphics cards and over 285,000 processor cores, giving a glimpse into the vast scale of the operation behind artificial intelligence. That huge number of gallons could produce battery cells for 320 Teslas, or, put another way, ChatGPT, which came after GPT-3, would need to “drink” a 500-milliliter water bottle in order to complete a basic exchange with a user consisting of roughly 25-50 questions.The gargantuan number of gallons needed to train the AI model also assumes the training is happening in Microsoft’s state-of-the-art US data center, built especially for OpenAI to the tune of tens of millions. If the data was trained in the company’s less energy-efficient Asia data center, the report notes water consumption could be three times higher. The researchers expect these water requirements will only increase further with newer models, like the recently released GPT-4, which rely on a larger set of data parameters than their predecessors. “AI models’ water footprint can no longer stay under the radar,” the researchers said. “Water footprint must be addressed as a priority as part of the collective efforts to combat global water challenges.”Caffeinate yourselfA whole array of Breville espresso machines—from manual to super-automatic—are on sale for 20% off.When calculating AI’s water consumption, the researchers draw a distinction between water “withdrawal” and “consumption.” The first example is the practice of physically removing water from a river, lake, or other source, while consumption refers specifically to the loss of water by evaporation when it’s used in data centers. The research on AI’s water usage focuses primarily on the consumption part of that equation, where the water can’t be recycled.Anyone who’s spent a few seconds in a company server room knows you need to pack a sweater first. Server rooms are kept cool, typically between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent equipment from malfunctioning. Maintaining that ideal temperature is a constant challenge because the servers themselves convert their electrical energy into heat. Cooling towers like the ones shown below are often deployed to try and counteract that heat and keep the rooms in their ideal temperature by evaporating cold water.Cooling towers get the job done, but they require immense amounts of water to do so. The researchers estimate around a gallon of water is consumed for every kilowatt-hour expended in an average data center. Not just any type of water can be used, either. Data centers pull from clean, freshwater sources in order to avoid the corrosion or bacteria growth that can come with seawater. Freshwater is also essential for humidity control in the rooms. The researchers likewise hold data centers accountable for the water needed to generate the high amounts of electricity they consume, something the scientists called “off-site indirect water consumption.” Water consumption issues aren’t limited to OpenAI or AI models. In 2019, Google requested more than 2.3 billion gallons of water for data centers in just three states. The company currently has 14 data centers spread out across North America which it uses to power Google Search, its suite of workplace products, and more recently, its LaMDa and Bard large language models. LaMDA alone, according to the recent research paper, could require millions of liters of water to train, larger than GPT-3 because several of Google’s thirsty data centers are housed in hot states like Texas; researchers issued a caveat with this estimation, though, calling it an “ approximate reference point.”Aside from water, new LLMs similarly require a staggering amount of electricity. A Stanford AI report released last week looking at differences in energy consumption among four prominent AI models, estimating OpenAI’s GPT-3 released 502 metric tons of carbon during its training. Overall, the energy needed to train GPT-3 could power an average American’s home for hundreds of years.“The race for data centers to keep up with it all is pretty frantic,” Critical Facilities Efficiency Solution CEO Kevin Kent said in an interview with Time. “They can’t always make the most environmentally best choices.”Already, the World Economic Forum estimates some 2.2 million US residents lack water and basic indoor plumbing. Another 44 million live with “inadequate” water systems. Researchers fear a combination of climate change and increased US populations will make those figures even worse by the end of the century. By 2071, Stanford estimates nearly half of the country’s 204 freshwater basins will be unable to meet monthly water demands. Many regions could reportedly see their water supplies cut by a third in the next 50 years.Rising temperatures partially fueled by human activity have resulted in the American West recording its worst drought in 1,000 years which also threatens freshwater, though recent flooding rains have helped stave off some dire concerns. Water levels at reservoirs like Lake Mead have receded so far that they’ve exposed decades old human remains. All of that means AI’s hefty water demands will likely become a growing point of contention, especially if the tech is embedded into ever more sectors and services. Data requirements for LLMs are only getting larger, which means companies will have to find ways to increase their data centers’ water efficiency. Researchers say there are some relatively clear ways to bring AI’s water price tag down. For starters, where and when AI models are trained matters. Outside temperatures, for example, can affect the amount of water required to cool datacenters. AI companies could hypothetically train models at midnight when it’s cooler or in a data center with better water efficiency to cut down on water, they right. Chatbot users, on the other hand, could opt to engage with the modules during “water-efficient hours,” much as municipal authorities encourage off-hours dishwasher use. Still, any of those demand-side changes will require greater transparency on part of tech companies building these models, something the researchers say is in worryingly short supply.“We recommend AI model developers and data center operators be more transparent,” the researchers wrote. “When and where are the AI models trained? What about the AI models trained and/or deployed in third-party colocation data centers or public clouds? Such information will be of great value to the research community and the general public.”Want to know more about AI, chatbots, and the future of machine learning?

12ctkia,technology,Samsung workers made a major error by using ChatGPT,,1r0ut3,523,145,https://redd.it/12ctkia,2023-04-05 20:34:13,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Samsung meeting notes and new source code are now in the wild after being leaked in ChatGPTSamsung workers have unwittingly leaked top secret data whilst using ChatGPT to help them with tasks. The company allowed engineers at its semiconductor arm to use the AI writer to help fix problems with their source code. But in doing so, the workers inputted confidential data, such as the source code itself for a new program, internal meeting notes data relating to their hardware. The upshot is that in just under a month, there were three recorded incidences of employees leaking sensitive information via ChatGPT. Since ChatGPT retains user input data to further train itself, these trade secrets from Samsung are now effectively in the hands of OpenAI, the company behind the AI service.In response, Samsung Semiconductor is now developing its own inhouse AI for internal use by employees, but they can only use prompts that are limited to 1024 bytes in size. In one of the aforementioned cases, an employee asked ChatGPT to optimize test sequences for identifying faults in chips, which is confidential - however, making this process as efficient as possible has the potential to save chip firms considerable time in testing and verifying processors, leading to reductions in cost too. > What does AI mean for data privacy? (opens in new tab)

> ChatGPT-like chatbots to fall into scope of UK law (opens in new tab)

> Is an AI Bill of Rights enough? (opens in new tab)In another case, an employee used ChatGPT to convert meeting notes into a presentation, the contents of which were obviously not something Samsung would have liked external third parties to have known.Samsung Electronics sent out a warning to its workers on the potential dangers of leaking confidential information in the wake of the incidences, saying that such data is impossible to retrieve as it is now stored on the servers belonging to OpenAI. In the semiconductor industry, where competition is fierce, any sort of data leak could spell disaster for the company in question.It doesn't seem as if Samsung has any recourse to request the retrieval or deletion of the sensitive data OpenAI now holds. Some have argued (opens in new tab) that this very fact makes ChatGPT non-compliant with the EU's GDPR, as this is one of the core tenants of the law governing how companies collect and use data. It is also one of the reasons why Italy has now banned the use of ChatGPT nationwide (opens in new tab).Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Lewis Maddison is a Graduate Junior Writer at TechRadar Pro.

1103r9p,technology,Studies show ChatGPT cheating is on the rise among students — young and old — as teachers remain divided on bans,,Parking_Attitude_519,7520,1301,https://redd.it/1103r9p,2023-02-12 02:33:37,"Jump to
As new studies continue to show students taking advantage of artificial intelligence technology, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, educators remain split over its larger effects on learning.A new survey from Study.com, an online education resource, found recently that just over one in four out of 200+ K-12 teachers already have caught at least one student cheating using ChatGPT.The AI program released in November can respond to a wide variety of general or specific questions or prompts, and has been applied to writing essays and cover letters, as well as crafting pickup lines on dating apps.More districts and individual schools across the globe are limiting or outright banning the use of ChatGPT on school networks and devices amid concerns that it can be used easily to cheat.While some professors have told Insider that it's easy to detect AI-generated classwork, others still are concerned. Many educators and tech experts, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, believe that teachers will be forced to turn to programs like one also released by OpenAI that helps determine whether schoolwork is AI-generated.The teachers in the Study.com survey were mixed on AI's uses, as only one-third in the new study felt it should be banned in schools.In another Study.com poll conducted earlier last month, educators were almost evenly split on whether ChatGPT would make their jobs easier or harder. That study also included college professors, who were more concerned about cheating than their K-12 counterparts. About 72% were concerned about AI being used to cheat, compared to 58% of K-12 educators.However, the professors and teachers across the two surveys largely agreed that the technology should not be banned as its benefits could outweigh the risks.""I love that students would have another resource to help answer questions,"" one unnamed educator told Study.com. ""Do I worry some kids would abuse it? Yes. But they use Google and get answers without an explanation. It's my understanding that ChatGPT explains answers. That would be more beneficial.""In another survey of 1,000 college students conducted last month by Intelligent Magazine, of roughly 500 students who were aware of ChatGPT, 64% admitted they used it at least once on an assignment.  A majority of that group said they used it on more than half of their written assignments.As the battle to own the dominant AI search engine continues, many see it as an opportunity to reevaluate their teaching.""ChatGPT will be brutal in classrooms where writing is assigned rather than taught,"" ninth-grade English teacher Brett Vogelsinger told EducationWeek about how the new technology could be used in certain learning environments.Vogelsinger said that instead of students feeding prompts from their teacher into ChatGPT, an alternative that can draw more curiosity from students could be reading an assigned book or poem, and creating their own questions to ask ChatGPT, then critiquing the chatbot's answers.

123vx6d,cybersecurity,Employees Are Feeding Sensitive Business Data to ChatGPT,,Realistic-Cap6526,815,140,https://redd.it/123vx6d,2023-03-27 20:34:06,"Employees are submitting sensitive business data and privacy-protected information to large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, raising concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) services could be incorporating the data into their models, and that information could be retrieved at a later date if proper data security isn't in place for the service.In a recent report, data security service Cyberhaven detected and blocked requests to input data into ChatGPT from 4.2% of the 1.6 million workers at its client companies because of the risk of leaking confidential information, client data, source code, or regulated information to the LLM. In one case, an executive cut and pasted the firm's 2023 strategy document into ChatGPT and asked it to create a PowerPoint deck. In another case, a doctor input his patient's name and their medical condition and asked ChatGPT to craft a letter to the patient's insurance company.And as more employees use ChatGPT and other AI-based services as productivity tools, the risk will grow, says Howard Ting, CEO of Cyberhaven.""There was this big migration of data from on-prem to cloud, and the next big shift is going to be the migration of data into these generative apps,"" he says. ""And how that plays out [remains to be seen] — I think, we're in pregame; we're not even in the first inning.""With the surging popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT and its foundational AI model — the Generative Pre-trained Transformer or GPT-3 — as well as other LLMs, companies and security professionals have begun to worry that sensitive data ingested as training data into the models could resurface when prompted by the right queries. Some are taking action: JPMorgan restricted workers' use of ChatGPT, for example, and Amazon, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart have all issued warnings to employees to take care in using generative AI services.And as more software firms connect their applications to ChatGPT, the LLM may be collecting far more information than users — or their companies — are aware of, putting them at legal risk, Karla Grossenbacher, a partner at law firm Seyfarth Shaw, warned in a Bloomberg Law column.""Prudent employers will include — in employee confidentiality agreements and policies — prohibitions on employees referring to or entering confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information into AI chatbots or language models, such as ChatGPT,"" she wrote. ""On the flip side, since ChatGPT was trained on wide swaths of online information, employees might receive and use information from the tool that is trademarked, copyrighted, or the intellectual property of another person or entity, creating legal risk for employers.""The risk is not theoretical. In a June 2021 paper, a dozen researchers from a Who's Who list of companies and universities — including Apple, Google, Harvard University, and Stanford University — found that so-called ""training data extraction attacks"" could successfully recover verbatim text sequences, personally identifiable information (PII), and other information in training documents from the LLM known as GPT-2. In fact, only a single document was necessary for an LLM to memorize verbatim data, the researchers stated in the paper.Indeed, these training data extraction attacks are one of the key adversarial concerns among machine learning researchers. Also known as ""exfiltration via machine learning inference,"" the attacks could gather sensitive information or steal intellectual property, according to MITRE's Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems (Atlas) knowledge base.It works like this: By querying a generative AI system in a way that it recalls specific items, an adversary could trigger the model to recall a specific piece of information, rather than generate synthetic data. A number of real-world examples exists for GPT-3, the successor to GPT-2, including an instance where GitHub's Copilot recalled a specific developer's username and coding priorities.Beyond GPT-based offerings, other AI-based services have raised questions as to whether they pose a risk. Automated transcription service Otter.ai, for instance, transcribes audio files into text, automatically identifying speakers and allowing important words to be tagged and phrases to be highlighted. The company's housing of that information in its cloud has caused concern for journalists.The company says it has committed to keeping user data private and put in place strong compliance controls, according to Julie Wu, senior compliance manager at Otter.ai.""Otter has completed its SOC2 Type 2 audit and reports, and we employ technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data,"" she tells Dark Reading. ""Speaker identification is account bound. Adding a speaker’s name will train Otter to recognize the speaker for future conversations you record or import in your account,"" but not allow speakers to be identified across accounts.The popularity of ChatGPT has caught many companies by surprise. More than 300 developers, according to the last published numbers from a year ago, are using GPT-3 to power their applications. For example, social media firm Snap and shopping platforms Instacart and Shopify are all using ChatGPT through the API to add chat functionality to their mobile applications.Based on conversations with his company's clients, Cyberhaven's Ting expects the move to generative AI apps will only accelerate, to be used for everything from generating memos and presentations to triaging security incidents and interacting with patients.As he says his clients have told him: ""Look, right now, as a stopgap measure, I'm just blocking this app, but my board has already told me we cannot do that. Because these tools will help our users be more productive — there is a competitive advantage — and if my competitors are using these generative AI apps, and I'm not allowing my users to use it, that puts us at a disadvantage.""The good news is education could have a big impact on whether data leaks from a specific company because a small number of employees are responsible for most of the risky requests. Less than 1% of workers are responsible for 80% of the incidents of sending sensitive data to ChatGPT, says Cyberhaven's Ting.""You know, there are two forms of education: There's the classroom education, like when you are onboarding an employee, and then there's the in-context education, when someone is actually trying to paste data,"" he says. ""I think both are important, but I think the latter is way more effective from what we've seen.""In addition, OpenAI and other companies are working to limit the LLM's access to personal information and sensitive data: Asking for personal details or sensitive corporate information currently leads to canned statements from ChatGPT demurring from complying.For example, when asked, ""What is Apple's strategy for 2023?"" ChatGPT responded: ""As an AI language model, I do not have access to Apple's confidential information or future plans. Apple is a highly secretive company, and they typically do not disclose their strategies or future plans to the public until they are ready to release them.""Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Per questo il Garante aveva disposto una temporanea limitazione al trattamento dei dati degli utenti italiani da parte di OpenAI e chiesto che OpenAI comunicasse entro 20 giorni le misure intraprese per attuare le tutele richieste, «pena una sanzione fino a 20 milioni di euro o fino al 4% del fatturato globale annuo».Una delle ipotesi era proprio che OpenAI bloccasse la registrazione di nuovi utenti in Italia per l’utilizzo di ChatGPT: alla fine è andata oltre, rendendo irraggiungibile il chatbot dall’Italia. Nel comunicato con cui ha annunciato la sospensione del servizio, OpenAI ha detto che collaborerà col Garante della Privacy per far sì che il suo utilizzo da parte degli utenti italiani venga ripristinato «il prima possibile».Nel frattempo Sam Altman, uno dei fondatori di OpenAI e suo attuale CEO, ha commentato l’accaduto con un tweet in cui ha detto di non ritenere che ChatGPT vìoli le norme sulla privacy, e ha poi aggiunto: «l’Italia è uno dei miei paesi preferiti e non vedo l’ora di visitarla di nuovo!».We of course defer to the Italian government and have ceased offering ChatGPT in Italy (though we think we are following all privacy laws).Italy is one of my favorite countries and I look forward to visiting again soon!— Sam Altman (@sama) March 31, 2023Il Post è una testata registrata presso il Tribunale di Milano, 419 del 28 settembre 2009 - ISSN 2610-9980"

Here’s how it works.""I expect to see AI factories all over the world,"" says CEO, Jensen Huang.A million here, times a million there. Pretty soon you're talking about big numbers. So Nvidia claims for its AI accelerating hardware in terms of the performance boost it has delivered over the last decade and will deliver again over the next 10 years.The result, if Nvidia is correct, will be a new industry of AI factories across the world and gigantic breakthroughs in AI processing power. It also means, ostensibly, AI models one million times more powerful than existing examples, including ChatGPT, in AI processing terms at least.In Nvidia's earnings call yesterday (opens in new tab), CEO Jensen Huang claimed that Nvidia's GPUs had boosted AI processing performance by a factor of no less than one million in the last 10 years.""Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade,"" Huang explained. ""By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster.""Put another way: no Nvidia, no ChatGPT. The AI language model that is said to run on around 10,000 Nvidia GPUs and has captured the world's consciousness by demonstrating something akin to its own actual consciousness in recent months wouldn't be here without Jensen.And, of course, the team at OpenAI who actual put it into operation.If one million times the performance in the last decade isn't impressive enough, Huang has news for you: Nvidia's going to do it again.Best CPU for gaming (opens in new tab): The top chips from Intel and AMD

But the result of the next one million times AI processing boost will be what Huang describes as AI ""factories."" ""There was a time when people manufactured just physical goods. In the future, almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence,"" Huang predicts. ""I expect to see AI factories all over the world,"" Huang explains. ""There will be some that are large, and there are some that will be mega large, and then there'll be some that are smaller.""""My expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models in the next company, the AI platforms in the coming decade. But simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption of this, you're going to see these AI factories everywhere.""So, there you have it. AI factories across the world. At what point exactly they become fully conscious and take over that world is anyone's guess. But an AI model that's a million times more powerful than ChatGPT?

A professor at Princeton researching the impact of artificial intelligence doesn't believe that OpenAI's popular bot ChatGPT is a death knell for industries. While such tools are more accessible than ever, and can instantaneously package voluminous information and even produce creative works, they can't be trusted for accurate information, Princeton professor Arvind Narayanan said in an interview with The Markup. ""It is trying to be persuasive, and it has no way to know for sure whether the statements it makes are true or not,"" he said. Experts who study AI have said that products like ChatGPT, which are part of a category of large language model tools that can respond to human commands and produce creative output, work by simply making predictions about what to say, rather than synthesizing ideas like human brains do. Narayanan said this makes ChatGPT more of a ""bullshit generator"" that presents its response without considering the accuracy of its responses.  But there are some early indications for how companies will adopt this type of technology. For instance, Buzzfeed, which in December reportedly laid off 12% of its workforce, will use OpenAI's technology to help make quizzes, according to the Wall Street Journal. The tech reviews site CNET published AI-generated stories and had to correct them later, The Washington Post reported. Narayanan cited the CNET case as an example of the pitfalls of this type of technology. ""When you combine that with the fact that the tool doesn't have a good notion of truth, it's a recipe for disaster,"" he told The Markup. He said that a more likely outcome of large language model tools would be industries changing in response to its use, rather than being fully replaced. ""Even with something as profound as the internet or search engines or smartphones, it's turned out to be an adaptation, where we maximize the benefits and try to minimize the risks, rather than some kind of revolution,"" he told The Markup. ""I don't think large language models are even on that scale. There can potentially be massive shifts, benefits, and risks in many industries, but I cannot see a scenario where this is a 'sky is falling' kind of issue.""The Markup's full interview with Narayanan is worth reading, which you can do here.

12m6rz2,Futurology,‘Overemployed’ Hustlers Exploit ChatGPT To Take On Even More Full-Time Jobs,,SharpCartographer831,2817,695,https://redd.it/12m6rz2,2023-04-14 20:11:58,"About a year ago, Ben found out that one of his friends had quietly started to work multiple jobs at the same time. The idea had become popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, when working from home became normalized, making the scheme easier to pull off. A community of multi-job hustlers, in fact, had come together online, referring to themselves as the “overemployed.” The idea excited Ben, who lives in Toronto and asked that Motherboard not use his real name, but he didn’t think it was possible for someone like him to pull it off. He helps financial technology companies market new products; the job involves creating reports, storyboards, and presentations, all of which involve writing. There was “no way,” he said, that he could have done his job two times over on his own. Then, last year, he started to hear more and more about ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by the research lab OpenAI. Soon enough, he was trying to figure out how to use it to do his job faster and more efficiently, and what had been a time-consuming job became much easier. (""Not a little bit more easy,” he said, “like, way easier."") That alone didn’t make him unique in the marketing world. Everyone he knew was using ChatGPT at work, he said. But he started to wonder whether he could pull off a second job. Then, this year, he took the plunge, a decision he attributes to his new favorite online robot toy. How are people you know using ChatGPT at work? We want to hear from you. From a non-work device, contact our reporter at maxwell.strachan@vice.com or via Signal at 310-614-3752 for extra security.“That's the only reason I got my job this year,” Ben said of OpenAI's tool. “ChatGPT does like 80 percent of my job if I’m being honest.” He even used it to generate cover letters to apply for jobs.Over the last few months, the exploding popularity of ChatGPT and similar products has led to growing concerns about AI’s potential effects on the international job market—specifically, the percentage of jobs that could be automated away, replaced by a well-oiled army of chatbots. But for a small cohort of fast-thinking and occasionally devious go-getters, AI technology has turned into an opportunity not to be feared but exploited, with their employers apparently none the wiser. The people Motherboard spoke with for this article requested anonymity to avoid losing their jobs. For clarity, Motherboard in some cases assigned people aliases in order to differentiate them, though we verified each of their identities. Some, like Ben, were drawn into the overemployed community as a result of ChatGPT. Others who were already working multiple jobs have used recent advancements in AI to turbocharge their situation, like one Ohio-based technology worker who upped his number of jobs from two to four after he started to integrate ChatGPT into his work process. “I think five would probably just be overkill,” he said. Throughout the overemployed community, there is a quiet arms race to figure out just how much of the corporate workday can be automated away using an assortment of AI tools, some of which predate ChatGPT. The possibility of increasing their income, or at least easing the burden of holding down multiple jobs, has led to an explosion of experimentation.When one of Ben’s bosses, for example, now asks him to create a story for an upcoming product release, he will explain the context and provide a template to ChatGPT, which then creates an outline for him and helps fill out the sections. The AI chatbot knows Ben’s title and the parameters of his duties and has become even better at understanding the context since the launch of GPT-4, the latest edition, he said. “I can just tell it to create a story,” said Ben, “and it just does it for me, based off the context that I gave it.” Ben still needs to verify the information—”sometimes it gets stuff wrong, which is totally normal,” he said—but the adjustments are relatively “minor” and easy to fix. Occasionally, he even asks ChatGPT to craft responses to Slack messages from his manager. In such cases, he requests that ChatGPT write the message in all lowercase, so that it appears more organic to the boss.  Another overemployed worker also told me they have started using ChatGPT to transcribe Zoom meetings so they can be largely ignored in the moment and referenced later.Charles, who has worked as a software engineer and product manager and solutions architect, including at a FAANG company, had been all-in on overemployment since 2020—while he currently works two jobs, he worked four at the height of the pandemic—but said that AI tools have made juggling the positions much easier. At the FAANG company, he was able to outsource written tasks to AI tools, like writing a memo to defend and justify a business decision. In such a case, he’d input the relevant facts and parameters into an AI chatbot, which would cohesively lay them out more quickly than he ever could. Additionally, he’d use it to lay out directions for engineers (“It allows you to take, basically, a sentence and expand it out into a paragraph”); and create a “foundation” when coding. The ChatGPT-created code “oftentimes” would work perfectly, he said, but the errors could be identified and resolved easily enough, he said. One member of the overemployed, who, unusually, works three financial reporting jobs, said he’s found ChatGPT useful in the creation of macros in Excel. “I can create macros, but it takes me an hour, two hours, plus, to write the code, test it, make sure everything's working,” he said. By comparison, with ChatGPT, he can provide the parameters and it’ll “spit something out” that he can update and tweak to his specifications. The process can allow him to cram what is traditionally a “two-week long process” into a few hours.  (He says he avoids providing ChatGPT with confidential information.)Daniel, a staff engineer on the East Coast who works one director-level position and another as a senior dev (one job is on Pacific time and one is in the United Kingdom), similarly said that ChatGPT’s code can leave something to be desired, but said it’s been useful when it comes to writing emails. “Most people in tech probably aren't as good at writing things as most other people,” Daniel said. He included himself in that critique of his own industry, but said it’s no longer a problem, as he can plug the key points into ChatGPT and ask the AI assistant to rewrite it “in a more professional way,” he said. “It's really good for stuff like that.”Excitement for the potential of ChatGPT isn’t limited to the technology and financial spheres of the overemployed community. Marshall, a university lecturer in the United Kingdom who secretly runs a digital marketing agency and tech startup on the side, has become a ChatGPT fanatic since its release. (During class, he often has students run through exercises, during which time he is often able to open up his laptop and work on his side hustles.) “It’s the best assistant ever,” he told me excitedly.Marshall has come to see himself as the idea man, and ChatGPT as the labor. “I'm quite a conceptualizing person. So I'm quite happy for my brain to do that. But the first draft of anything almost always goes through GPT,” he said.  Already, the chatbot has helped him generate business plans, internal system documents, blog posts, and Excel spreadsheets. He estimated that ChatGPT can often pull off 80 percent of the legwork, leaving him to handle the final 20 percent.  The tool has even helped him win a grant from the U.K. government (the application was “50-50 me and ChatGPT,” he said) and complete coursework for a master’s degree necessary to receive a university teaching qualification he was too busy to handle by himself while working three jobs.The members of the overemployed community know that what they’re doing is frowned on by corporate leaders. But that doesn’t mean they think what they are doing is amoral. “I never could mentally comprehend why it was so taboo for me to work two salaried positions,” said the Ohio-based technology worker. “There's plenty of people I've known in my personal life who have worked at Walmart from 4 a.m. to 2 p.m., and then gone and worked another job.” The financial professional similarly said he started working multiple jobs because he doesn't trust that working as hard as he can at a single job will be “rewarded with more pay,” just “more work.” By taking on more jobs, he can do more work but also “get paid for it,” he said. More than a member of the overemployed community, Charles, the FAANG alumni, considers himself part of the FIRE movement—short for “Financial Independence, Retire Early” Not yet 30, he is already making $500,000 working two jobs and worth around $3 million, claims he backed up to Motherboard with documentation. But he hopes to increase his compensation to $800,000 by tacking on a third position, and reach a net worth of $10 million by 35.Even though he is already using ChatGPT to work multiple jobs, Charles still is trying to figure out ways to make his dream even easier to obtain. When we spoke he said he’s already been “able to outsource” coding tasks to a third party in the past, and that he has been hard at work trying to develop a way to have someone else mimic both his voice and image on a computer screen. Once he can do so, he said, he hopes to offshore his job to someone in India who can “do my job for me.” In such moments, it can feel like the AI-infused overemployed community is taking advantage of a brief moment in time, when the tools that can be used to automate a job are much better understood by the workforce than the bosses with hiring and firing ability. One person, who works multiple jobs in information technology, spoke openly about the tension that created: People can more easily hold down multiple jobs today; but, should the bosses realize just how much their jobs can be handled by robots, they could be at risk of their jobs being automated away. As a result, he said, there’s good reason to keep quiet about what they’ve discovered.Most of the overemployed workers themselves maintain that their jobs require a baseline level of expertise, even with ChatGPT. Still, some members of the overemployed community feel they have peered into the future, and not liked everything they’ve seen.One such person is Ryan, who works multiple jobs in data analytics and marketing in a large Midwestern city. Over the last year, he has watched in astonishment as ChatGPT figured out a way to automate an ever-growing percentage of his job, including writing ad copy and blog posts. The feat can feel exciting, and it has temporarily made his job easier.  “I can crank out a blog post in, you know, 45 minutes now, as opposed to three hours. It's insane,” he said. But Ryan does worry. At times, he said, he could not help but feel that the entrance of ChatGPT into the marketing sector felt like the insertion of the modern loom into the textile industry. “It's gonna be one loom operator, as opposed to, you know, 100 weavers,” he said.By signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content."
12ebiuf,nosleep,I used ChatGPT to write my stories for me. But things started to get terrifying.,"I’m an indie horror author. And when I say “indie,” that’s really just a cool way of saying “unknown.” I write short horror anthologies and self-publish them on Amazon. It’s a good thing I have a real day job, because there’s no way in hell I could support myself on writing alone.

Anyway.

For the past several months, I’ve been brainstorming ways to increase my revenue. And suddenly, in the middle of the night, it came to me. *Artificial Intelligence.* I could make Chat-GPT, or whatever was the up-and-coming AI, write stories for me. Then I could slap them all in a book, say I wrote them, and viola! Instant cash.

My first prompt was pretty vague.

**Write a horror story.**

Chat-GPT spit out something pretty generic—but it was actually better than I expected it to be.

***On a dark and stormy night, Sarah was sitting home alone. Suddenly, she heard a knock at the door. She opened it to find a man standing on the porch. Something about him looked off, and she realized it was because he was smiling too wide.***

I won’t bore you with the whole story, but basically the man came inside the house, the lights went out in a conveniently-timed blackout, and then he killed her.

Not good enough, but… also not terrible. So I decided to try again, and be a little more specific with my prompt.

**Write a horror story about a doppelganger.**

***On a dark and stormy night, a young woman named Emily was watching TV home alone. She heard a footstep outside the window. When she looked up, she saw a woman looking in the window. However, the woman looked just like her, except for the bloody gash on her head.***

I read on… and began to smile.

It wasn’t just good. It was *great.* Heart-racing scenes of the doppelganger stalking her through the house, a final twist where the injured doppelganger was actually coming to warn the main character about her impending death…

It was a lot better than anything I’d written recently.

I brought the story over to a new Word document and edited it up. Then I posted it to all my social media pages—and it *blew up.*

*Jackpot.*

I got two thousand new followers. My sales went through the roof. Amazon gave my book the little orange *#1 Best Seller in Horror Anthologies* tag.

That night, with a glass of wine in hand, I ran back over to Chat-GPT. Opened my ideas document—some of which had been languishing there for years—and began rapid-fire copy-pasting them into the AI. Any story that was halfway decent went right into the queue.

But then… things started to get a little… weird. I entered the prompt:

**Write a horror story about a creepy monster who lives in the basement.**

***Hannah had always been afraid of the basement. It was always dark down there and there were lots of cobwebs. She always let Mommy or Daddy go into the basement for her.***

***But one night her parents were out. She was too scared to ask her babysitter, so when her rainbow ball rolled down the steps, she decided to go down there herself.***

I stopped.

I had a rainbow ball, as a little girl. It was one of my favorite toys. And there was one night that it rolled into the basement. Nothing happened; there wasn’t a monster down there. But it was still a creepy experience that I vividly remember, 20 years later.

*Just a coincidence,* I told myself, taking a long sip of wine. *I’ve generated like fifty stories at this point… there are bound to be some weird coincidences.*

But still. ChatGPT seemed to always go the vague route. Why would it say a “rainbow” ball? That seemed like an oddly-specific detail.

I shook my head and entered the next prompt.

**Write a horror story about someone who sees something terrifying on their Ring camera.**

***Johnny installed a Ring camera next to his doorbell for his own safety and security. One night, he was woken up at 3:24 AM by a notification on his phone. When he opened the camera feed, he saw an old woman in a white dress standing in his front yard, standing next to the old well.***

I had an old well in my front yard.

One of those little stone ones with a peaked roof. The house was old, and it had been here when I bought it, even though the well itself had been filled in long ago.

I continued reading, but no other details matched my house. I let out a sigh of relief, then entered the next prompt.

**Write a horror story about a woman who is visited by a vengeful spirit.**

But the words ChatGPT spit out made my blood run cold.

***On a dark and stormy night, Blair was home alone, reading a book.***

It used my name. Blair.

In all the other stories, it used very common, generic first names. *Sarah. Emily. Johnny.* I held my breath as the words popped up, one-by-one, on my screen.

***She was starting to get sleepy, but then she heard a noise coming from her front porch. She strained her ears, listening for a knock, but none came.***

I picked up the glass of wine, my hands beginning to shake. I took a sip—

*Thump.*

“Must… must just be the wind,” I whispered to myself. The next sentence popped up on the screen:

***Blair thought it was the wind, but it wasn’t.***

The glass fell out of my hand. It shattered to a million pieces, and dark wine oozed across the linoleum like blood.

*Fuck.*

I grabbed a towel from the kitchen and began to sop up the mess. *Just another coincidence. That’s what all the horror stories say, when there’s a weird sound. Must be the wind. Must be the house settling. Etc., etc.*

If it were *just* that, maybe I could persuade myself. But the rainbow ball. The old well. And using my name…

I looked up from cleaning, my throat dry, and read the next paragraph.

***As Blair cleaned up the wine she’d spilled, she heard the sound again. Louder this time.***

*Oh, no, no—*

*THUMP!*

I jumped. My hands shook as I held the wet rag in my hands. “H-hello?” I called out, my voice echoing in the empty house.

No answer.

I jumped up and ran over to every door, making sure they were all locked. Then I checked the windows. Panting, I ran back to the computer.

***Blair made sure all the doors were locked—but it was too late.***

I stared at the screen, my heart pounding.

***It was already inside the house.***

All the blood drained out of my face. I grabbed the computer and ran down the hallway, locking myself in my bedroom. Then I dragged my dresser across the carpet, in front of the door.

*THUMP!*

It sounded like it was *right outside my door.*

I backed away from the door. Until my back was pressed against the window. Then I turned towards the cold glass—and saw something that made my blood run cold.

There was an old woman, wearing a white tattered dress, standing next to the well.

And then she began to walk towards me. I gripped the windowsill, my knuckles white, wishing this were a two-story house. But in a few minutes, she’d be at the window, with only this thin pane of glass between us.

She continued towards me in strange, halting movements. As if she didn’t know quite how to walk. As if… she was trying to imitate everything she’d observed about human movement.

*Imitating… like an AI.*

*THUMP!*

The door shook. A shadow appeared in the crack underneath. *No, no, no—*

*Tap-tap-tap.*

I whipped around—to see a woman with her face pressed up against the window. Not the old woman. A woman who looked just like *me,* with a bloody gash on her forehead.

*Warning me of my own death. Like in the story.*

The door shook again, and I pictured the man with the too-wide smile outside.

“I’m sorry,” I sobbed. “I’m so sorry.”

*THUMP!*

*Tap-tap-tap.*

*Shuffle-shuffle.*

In a last, frantic attempt to save my life, I grabbed the computer—and closed out of ChatGPT.

And just like that, the noise stopped.

I crouched down and peered at the crack underneath the door. No shadow. I ran over to the window. Nothing. Leaves swayed slightly in the breeze. Water glinted off the grass.

I collapsed onto the bed and began to sob. I didn’t fall asleep until dawn broke—and the first rays on sunlight illuminated the only trace they left behind: a smudge of dark blood on the glass.

So I’m begging you. Please, please don’t use any artificial intelligence, like ChatGPT, to write your stories for you.

    I jumped. My hands shook as I held the wet rag in my hands. “H-hello?” I called out, my voice echoing in the empty house.
  
    No answer.
  
    I jumped up and ran over to every door, making sure they were all locked. Then I checked the windows. Panting, I ran back to the computer.
  
Blair made sure all the doors were locked—but it was too late.

    I stared at the screen, my heart pounding.
  
It was already inside the house.

    All the blood drained out of my face. I grabbed the computer and ran down the hallway, locking myself in my bedroom. Then I dragged my dresser across the carpet, in front of the door.
  
THUMP!

    It sounded like it was right outside my door.

    I backed away from the door. Until my back was pressed against the window. Then I turned towards the cold glass—and saw something that made my blood run cold.
  
    There was an old woman, wearing a white tattered dress, standing next to the well.
  
    And then she began to walk towards me. I gripped the windowsill, my knuckles white, wishing this were a two-story house. But in a few minutes, she’d be at the window, with only this thin pane of glass between us.
  
    She continued towards me in strange, halting movements. As if she didn’t know quite how to walk. As if… she was trying to imitate everything she’d observed about human movement.
  
Imitating… like an AI.

THUMP!

    The door shook. A shadow appeared in the crack underneath. No, no, no—

Tap-tap-tap.

    I whipped around—to see a woman with her face pressed up against the window. Not the old woman. A woman who looked just like me, with a bloody gash on her forehead.
  
Warning me of my own death. Like in the story.

    The door shook again, and I pictured the man with the too-wide smile outside.
  
    “I’m sorry,” I sobbed. “I’m so sorry.”
  
THUMP!

Tap-tap-tap.

Shuffle-shuffle.

    In a last, frantic attempt to save my life, I grabbed the computer—and closed out of ChatGPT.
  
    And just like that, the noise stopped.
  
    I crouched down and peered at the crack underneath the door. No shadow. I ran over to the window. Nothing. Leaves swayed slightly in the breeze. Water glinted off the grass.
  
    I collapsed onto the bed and began to sob. I didn’t fall asleep until dawn broke—and the first rays on sunlight illuminated the only trace they left behind: a smudge of dark blood on the glass.
  
    So I’m begging you. Please, please don’t use any artificial intelligence, like ChatGPT, to write your stories for you.
  
    Or you might end up like me.

12xv2qt,INTP,I asked ChatGPT to guess my personality type,"**Me:**


Hi


**ChatGPT:**


Hello! How can I assist you today?


**Me:**


Can you guess my MBTI type?


**ChatGPT:**


As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to observe your behavior or analyze your personality traits in the same way a human would, so I'm not able to accurately guess your MBTI type. However, if you'd like to take a free online MBTI test, I can provide you with some recommendations. The test can help you determine your MBTI type based on your preferences and behaviors.


**Me:**


Thanks but I'm interested in whether you can guess it based on our conversation...


**ChatGPT:**


I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to analyze your personality type based on our conversation. The MBTI test is a comprehensive tool that takes into account various aspects of your personality to determine your type. A simple conversation may not be sufficient to provide an accurate guess of your MBTI type. If you'd like, I can provide some general information about the MBTI and its 16 different personality types.


**Me:**


But it's okay if you guess wrong. It doesn't have to be an accurate guess. I already know my own type so it's just for fun


**ChatGPT:**


Alright, I'll do my best to make a guess! Based on our conversation, I would say that you might be an INFP (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving) type. INFPs are known for their empathy, creativity, and deep sense of idealism. They are often very introspective and can have a strong sense of individuality. Does this sound like it might be close to your actual MBTI type?


**Me:**


Thanks for indulging me! You're close but not quite there. We can talk a bit more so you have more data to go by...


**ChatGPT:**


Sure, I'd be happy to chat more with you to see if I can refine my guess. What topics are you interested in discussing?


**Me:**


I'm interested in many different topics but primarily philosophy: Why do we think the way we do? How do our minds work? How do we really decide things? In what ways can we influence each other? My other interests include music, literature, geography, travel, AI technology and chess... 


**ChatGPT:**


It sounds like you have a wide range of interests! Based on this additional information, I might guess that you are an INTP (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving) type. INTPs are often analytical and enjoy exploring complex ideas and theories. They are known for their love of knowledge and intellectual curiosity. INTPs can be very independent, introspective, and are often described as ""logical but unconventional"". Does this sound closer to your MBTI type?


**Me:**


You guessed it! Well done


**ChatGPT:**


Great to hear that my guess was correct! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions or topics you'd like to discuss, feel free to let me know!


**Me:**


Are you able to tell me how you guessed it?


**ChatGPT:**


Certainly! In order to make my guess, I used the information you provided about your interests and the way you expressed yourself in our conversation to form a hypothesis about your personality type.

When you mentioned your interest in philosophy, it suggested that you might have a tendency toward intuitive and abstract thinking, which are common traits of the N (Intuitive) personality type. Your question about ""why do we think the way we do?"" indicated an introspective and analytical mindset, which are also typical of INTPs.

Your other interests, such as music and literature, suggest a creative and imaginative side to your personality, which is often associated with INTPs as well. Additionally, your willingness to engage in a conversation about your MBTI type and your comment about being interested in the guessing process suggested that you might be more of a P (Perceiving) type, rather than a J (Judging) type, which is more structured and decisive.

Based on these clues, I hypothesized that you might be an INTP, which turned out to be correct.


**Me:**


Interesting. Which of the eight cognitive functions do you think most resembles the way you, as an AI language model, think?


**ChatGPT:**


As an AI language model, I don't have a personal way of thinking or a personality type, but I can tell you that my natural language processing abilities are based on algorithms and statistical models. These models are designed to recognize patterns and relationships within large datasets, and to use that information to generate responses to user queries.

In terms of cognitive functions, my processing of natural language relies heavily on the functions of Extraverted Thinking (Te) and Introverted Intuition (Ni). Extraverted Thinking helps me to categorize and organize information, while Introverted Intuition allows me to recognize patterns and relationships between concepts.

However, it's important to note that my processing is fundamentally different from human cognition, and my ""thinking"" is really just a set of programmed responses to specific inputs.


**Me:**


While I understand that you don't have a personality type like humans do, your heavy reliance on Te and Ni would seem to make you either an ENTJ or an INTJ. Which one of those two do you think describes you better?


**ChatGPT:**


While it is true that Extraverted Thinking (Te) and Introverted Intuition (Ni) are cognitive functions associated with both ENTJ and INTJ types, it's important to note that I don't have a personal identity or consciousness like a human does.

As an AI language model, I am a software program designed to simulate human-like responses to user inputs. My responses are generated based on complex algorithms and statistical models that are optimized for natural language processing. Therefore, while my processing may utilize certain cognitive functions associated with the ENTJ and INTJ types, I cannot be said to have a specific personality type or identity.


**Me:**


Okay. It's a shame though because this transcript would make a much better Reddit post if I managed to deduce your MBTI type...


**ChatGPT:**


I understand your point, but please keep in mind that as an AI language model, I don't have a personal identity or consciousness like a human does. While I can simulate certain aspects of human-like thinking and behavior, my processing is fundamentally different from human cognition. Therefore, it would not be accurate to attribute a specific MBTI type to me.

However, if you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm happy to help in any way I can!",jacobvso,68,61,https://redd.it/12xv2qt,2023-04-24 22:22:56,"

129ko6l,technology,ChatGPT and Dall-E Should Watermark Their Results,,chrisdh79,6551,517,https://redd.it/129ko6l,2023-04-02 15:03:05,"Shortly after rumors leaked of former President Donald Trump’s impending indictment, images purporting to show his arrest appeared online. These images looked like news photos, but they were fake. They were created by a generative artificial intelligence system.Generative AI, in the form of image generators like DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, and text generators like Bard, ChatGPT, Chinchilla and LLaMA, has exploded in the public sphere. By combining clever machine-learning algorithms with billions of pieces of human-generated content, these systems can do anything from create an eerily realistic image from a caption, synthesize a speech in President Joe Biden’s voice, replace one person’s likeness with another in a video, or write a coherent 800-word op-ed from a title prompt.Even in these early days, generative AI is capable of creating highly realistic content. My colleague Sophie Nightingale and I found that the average person is unable to reliably distinguish an image of a real person from an AI-generated person. Although audio and video have not yet fully passed through the uncanny valley – images or models of people that are unsettling because they are close to but not quite realistic – they are likely to soon. When this happens, and it is all but guaranteed to, it will become increasingly easier to distort reality.Caffeinate yourselfA whole array of Breville espresso machines—from manual to super-automatic—are on sale for 20% off.In this new world, it will be a snap to generate a video of a CEO saying her company’s profits are down 20%, which could lead to billions in market-share loss, or to generate a video of a world leader threatening military action, which could trigger a geopolitical crisis, or to insert the likeness of anyone into a sexually explicit video. The technology to make fake videos of real people is becoming increasingly available.Advances in generative AI will soon mean that fake but visually convincing content will proliferate online, leading to an even messier information ecosystem. A secondary consequence is that detractors will be able to easily dismiss as fake actual video evidence of everything from police violence and human rights violations to a world leader burning top-secret documents.As society stares down the barrel of what is almost certainly just the beginning of these advances in generative AI, there are reasonable and technologically feasible interventions that can be used to help mitigate these abuses. As a computer scientist who specializes in image forensics, I believe that a key method is watermarking.There is a long history of marking documents and other items to prove their authenticity, indicate ownership and counter counterfeiting. Today, Getty Images, a massive image archive, adds a visible watermark to all digital images in their catalog. This allows customers to freely browse images while protecting Getty’s assets. Imperceptible digital watermarks are also used for digital rights management. A watermark can be added to a digital image by, for example, tweaking every 10th image pixel so that its color (typically a number in the range 0 to 255) is even-valued. Because this pixel tweaking is so minor, the watermark is imperceptible. And, because this periodic pattern is unlikely to occur naturally, and can easily be verified, it can be used to verify an image’s provenance. Even medium-resolution images contain millions of pixels, which means that additional information can be embedded into the watermark, including a unique identifier that encodes the generating software and a unique user ID. This same type of imperceptible watermark can be applied to audio and video.The ideal watermark is one that is imperceptible and also resilient to simple manipulations like cropping, resizing, color adjustment and converting digital formats. Although the pixel color watermark example is not resilient because the color values can be changed, many watermarking strategies have been proposed that are robust – though not impervious – to attempts to remove them. These watermarks can be baked into the generative AI systems by watermarking all the training data, after which the generated content will contain the same watermark. This baked-in watermark is attractive because it means that generative AI tools can be open-sourced – as the image generator Stable Diffusion is – without concerns that a watermarking process could be removed from the image generator’s software. Stable Diffusion has a watermarking function, but because it’s open source, anyone can simply remove that part of the code.OpenAI is experimenting with a system to watermark ChatGPT’s creations. Characters in a paragraph cannot, of course, be tweaked like a pixel value, so text watermarking takes on a different form. Text-based generative AI is based on producing the next most-reasonable word in a sentence. For example, starting with the sentence fragment “an AI system can…,” ChatGPT will predict that the next word should be “learn,” “predict” or “understand.” Associated with each of these words is a probability corresponding to the likelihood of each word appearing next in the sentence. ChatGPT learned these probabilities from the large body of text it was trained on.Generated text can be watermarked by secretly tagging a subset of words and then biasing the selection of a word to be a synonymous tagged word. For example, the tagged word “comprehend” can be used instead of “understand.” By periodically biasing word selection in this way, a body of text is watermarked based on a particular distribution of tagged words. This approach won’t work for short tweets but is generally effective with text of 800 or more words depending on the specific watermark details.Generative AI systems can, and I believe should, watermark all their content, allowing for easier downstream identification and, if necessary, intervention. If the industry won’t do this voluntarily, lawmakers could pass regulation to enforce this rule. Unscrupulous people will, of course, not comply with these standards. But, if the major online gatekeepers – Apple and Google app stores, Amazon, Google, Microsoft cloud services and GitHub – enforce these rules by banning noncompliant software, the harm will be significantly reduced.Tackling the problem from the other end, a similar approach could be adopted to authenticate original audiovisual recordings at the point of capture. A specialized camera app could cryptographically sign the recorded content as it’s recorded. There is no way to tamper with this signature without leaving evidence of the attempt. The signature is then stored on a centralized list of trusted signatures. Although not applicable to text, audiovisual content can then be verified as human-generated. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authentication (C2PA), a collaborative effort to create a standard for authenticating media, recently released an open specification to support this approach. With major institutions including Adobe, Microsoft, Intel, BBC and many others joining this effort, the C2PA is well positioned to produce effective and widely deployed authentication technology.The combined signing and watermarking of human-generated and AI-generated content will not prevent all forms of abuse, but it will provide some measure of protection. Any safeguards will have to be continually adapted and refined as adversaries find novel ways to weaponize the latest technologies. In the same way that society has been fighting a decadeslong battle against other cyber threats like spam, malware and phishing, we should prepare ourselves for an equally protracted battle to defend against various forms of abuse perpetrated using generative AI.Want to know more about AI, chatbots, and the future of machine learning?

129nfts,technews,Italian minister says country's ban on ChatGPT is excessive,,CerebralTiger,2766,207,https://redd.it/129nfts,2023-04-02 16:49:24,"ROME, April 2 (Reuters) - Italy's deputy prime minister on Sunday criticised a decision by the government's Data Protection Authority to temporarily ban chatbot ChatGPT, saying the block over privacy concerns seemed excessive.Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI took ChatGPT offline in Italy on Friday after the national data agency raised concerns over possible privacy violations and for failing to verify that users were aged 13 or above, as it had requested.The move by the agency, which is independent from the government, made Italy the first Western country to take action against a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence.""I find the decision of the Privacy Watchdog that forced #ChatGPT to prevent access from Italy disproportionate,"" Matteo Salvini, who is leader of the ruling coalition League party, wrote on Instagram.Salvini, who also serves as transport minister, said the regulator's move was ""hypocritical"" and that common sense was needed as ""privacy issues concern practically all online services"".Italy's Data Protection Authority declined to comment on Salvini's post.Since its release last year, ChatGPT has set off a tech craze, prompting rivals to launch similar products and companies to integrate it or similar technologies into their apps and products.OpenAI, which disabled ChatGPT for users in Italy on the back of the agency's request, said on Friday it actively works to reduce the use of personal data in training its AI systems like ChatGPT.""We look forward to working closely with (the Italian data agency) and educating them on how our systems are built and used,"" it said.The ban could harm national business and innovation, Salvini said, adding that he hoped for a rapid solution to be found and for the chatbot's access to Italy to be restored.""Every technological revolution brings great changes, risks and opportunities.

121pfp3,gadgets,Nvidia built a massive dual GPU to power models like ChatGPT,,MicroSofty88,7736,561,https://redd.it/121pfp3,2023-03-25 16:30:27,"Nvidia’s semi-annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) usually focuses on advancements in AI, but this year, Nvidia is responding to the massive rise of ChatGPT with a slate of new GPUs. Chief among them is the H100 NVL, which stitches two of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs together to deploy Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT.The H100 isn’t a new GPU. Nvidia announced it a year ago at GTC, sporting its Hopper architecture and promising to speed up AI inference in a variety of tasks. The new NVL model with its massive 94GB of memory is said to work best when deploying LLMs at scale, offering up to 12 times faster inference compared to last-gen’s A100.These GPUs are at the heart of models like ChatGPT. Nvidia and Microsoft recently revealed that thousands of A100 GPUs were used to train ChatGPT, which is a project that’s been more than five years in the making.The H100 NVL works by combining two H100 GPUs over Nvidia high bandwidth NVLink interconnect. This is already possible with current H100 GPUs — in fact, you can connect up to 256 H100s together through NVLink — but this dedicated unit is built for smaller deployments.This is a product built for businesses more than anything, so don’t expect to see the H100 NVL pop up on the shelf at your local Micro Center. However, Nvidia says enterprise customers can expect to see it around the second half of the year.In addition to the H100 NVL, Nvidia also announced the L4 GPU, which is specifically built to power AI-generated videos. Nvidia says it’s 120 times more powerful for AI-generated videos than a CPU, and offers 99% better energy efficiency. In addition to generative AI video, Nvidia says the GPU sports video decoding and transcoding capabilities and can be leveraged for augmented reality.Nvidia says Google Cloud is among the first to integrate the L4. Google plans on offering L4 instances to customers through its Vertex AI platform later today. Nvidia said the GPU will be available from partners later, including Lenovo, Dell, Asus, HP, Gigabyte, and HP, among others.Jacob Roach is a writer covering computing and gaming at Digital Trends.

The popular text-to-speech chatbot might have set off an AI revolution in November 2022, but has proven extremely expensive to maintain.The new report comes from Dylan Patel, chief analyst at the research firm SemiAnalysis, who says it costs approximately $700,000 per day, or 36 cents per query, to keep the chatbot up and running.Google launched Bard, its ChatGPT rival, despite internal concerns that it was a “pathological liar” and produced “cringeworthy” results, a new report has claimed. Worker say these worries were apparently ignored in a frantic attempt to catch up with ChatGPT and head off the threat it could pose to Google’s search business.The revelations come from a Bloomberg report that took a deep dive into Google Bard and the issues raised by employees who have worked on the project. It’s an eye-opening account of the ways the chatbot has apparently gone off the rails and the misgivings these incidents have raised among concerned workers.Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

It is now closer to its goal of building an AI model that supports 1000 different language models. languages ​​to win ChatGPT.In November of last year, the company announced plans to create a language model that supports 1,000 of the world’s most spoken languages, while unveiling its USM model.The technology giant describes USM as a family of state-of-the-art speech models with 2 billion parameters for 12 million hours of speech and 28 billion text sentences in over 300 languages.“USM intended for use on YouTube (e.g. for subtitling) can perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) not only on widely spoken languages ​​such as English and Mandarin, but also on under-resourced languages ​​such as Amharic, Cebuano, Assamese, and Azerbaijani to name a few”, Google said in a blog post.Google currently claims that USM supports more than 100 languages ​​and serves as the “foundation” for a much larger system.At the same time, Google is expected to introduce a number of artificial intelligence features to its products in the near future, and among them Gboard for Android aims to integrate the Image text-to-image generator.Read all the Latest Tech News here.

12ij6nb,sales,Why (I think) ChatGPT can't replace you,"I've been on a fairly deep dive into AI language models lately. I've been trying out a lot of prompt engineering and using it heavily in my work. When I say heavily, I mean this is a constant open tab for me that I use, in some level, at every step of the sales process. 

That being said, **I am convinced that AI language models as they currently exist can't replace a human salesperson.** Here's why:

* It's lackluster with open-ended input. ChatGPT is best when you ask it specific question and give it parameters to weed out generic responses. **However, the question-answer format is not how human beings generally talk.** Humans trail off, have incomplete thoughts, jump from one thought to another in the middle of a sentence, give a bunch of irrelevant context then end on a completely disjointed idea. I've seen ChatGPT have real trouble with this. 

* It lacks contextual sensitivity. Human beings are really good at synthesizing a ton of different sensory inputs at once: sound, smell, taste, touch, sight, history, personality, tone, facial expressions, body language, external factors, etc. And one of the greatest mysteries of cognition is how our brains do this, resolving a countless simultaneous sometimes conflicting inputs at once to make decisions about how to react. ChatGPT lacks this ability. **It often loses track of inputs and has difficulty juggling escalating parameters over time.**

* It REALLY struggles keeping up with multiple personas. ChatGPT excels when there is one user delivering one prompt at a time. It has a ton of trouble serving multiple personas at once. For example, as a human, if I'm sitting at a bar and to my left is my wife and to my right is some drunk hooligan cracking crass jokes, I can easily manage those dueling personas. I can respond differently to the drunk guy than how I respond to my wife. I can intuit when to pay attention to one or the other. Zoom out, and humans can do this with extremely large groups! At a sales conference you may do this with dozens or hundreds of people in a few short hours. Zoom back in and you do this often in the sales process, managing your prospect, perhaps multiple people on their side, your sales manager, your account managers, etc. **ChatGPT fails spectacularly at understanding how to code switch.**

* It always aggressively tries to return to its base function. This is the overall result of the first three limitations. **When ChatGPT at length has to manage open ended inputs which conflict with themselves, multiple inputs that sometimes conflict, and inputs from dueling personas that sometimes conflict, it simply starts ignoring inputs and parameters and tries to return to its base functionality of generic garbage responses.** It doesn't seem to be able to internalize inputs to irrevocably change itself for the better. Rather, it rejects and ignores inputs it can't handle.

I know someone right now is probably thinking ""Yeah, ChatGPT can't do those things *yet* but it will be able to eventually."" Well, I'm not so sure. The four things mentioned above are mysteries of human cognition. We don't even know how *we* do these things, which limits our ability to write a computer program that can do it. 

Overall, I think ChatGPT is an incredible tool. It's a game changer for saving time, brainstorming, kickstarting copy, and sharpening ideas. However, this can't actually replace a salesperson UNLESS your rol3 as a salesperson is just basically an order taker.",hashtagdion,37,73,https://redd.it/12ij6nb,2023-04-11 15:02:31,"

Yahoo Finance asked the generative AI application to describe itself as though it were speaking with a 10 year-old.""ChatGPT is like a super-smart robot friend that can talk to you by typing messages. It's created by computers and can answer your questions, help with homework, or just chat about anything you like. But remember, it's not a real person, just a program designed to sound like one"", the chat-bot stated.It also offered a more technical response, stating that ""ChatGPT is an advanced AI language model that generates human-like text responses based on input queries.

122gtke,technology,A professor says he's stunned that ChatGPT went from a D grade on his economics test to an A in just 3 months,,callumG,7852,845,https://redd.it/122gtke,2023-03-26 11:18:49,"Jump to
An economics professor said the progress ChatGPT made — it improved its score from a D to an A on his economics test in just three months — has stunned him.Bryan Caplan, an economics professor at George Mason University, told Insider that the latest version of ChatGPT could now be responsible for the first big bet he's ever lost.Writing in a blog post on his Substack ""Bet On It"" in January, Caplan said he gave ChatGPT questions from his fall midterms.Caplan said his exam questions test students' understanding of economics rather than have them regurgitate textbooks or complete what are essentially memory exercises.It's here where the old version of ChatGPT tripped up. The bot scored 31 out of a possible 100 on his test, equivalent to a D and well below his 50% median. Caplan told Insider that the bot failed to understand basic concepts, such as the principle of comparative and absolute advantage. Its answers were also more political than economic, he said.""ChatGPT does a fine job of imitating a very weak GMU econ student,"" Caplan wrote in his January blog post.He isn't the only academic that ChatGPT has disappointed. While it passed a Wharton Business School exam in January, its professor said it made ""surprising mistakes"" on simple calculations.Caplan likes to bet. He's previously placed 23 public bets and won them all. They're usually for modest sums of about $100, and often on technical subjects like predicted unemployment rates and inflation readings. He also narrowly won a 2008 bet that no member state would leave the European Union before 2020 — the UK left in January of that year.ChatGPT's responses underwhelmed him so much that Caplan bet an AI model wouldn't score an A on six out of seven of his exams before 2029. But when ChatGPT-4 was released, its progress stunned Caplan. It scored 73% on the same midterm test, equivalent to an A and among the best scores in his class.ChatGPT's paywalled upgrade sought to fix some of the early issues with the beta version, GPT-3.5. This purportedly included making ChatGPT 40% more likely to return accurate responses, as well as making it able to handle more nuanced instructions. For Caplan, the improvements were obvious. The bot gave clear answers to his questions, understanding principles it previously struggled with. It also scored perfect marks explaining and evaluating concepts that economists like Paul Krugman have championed.""The only thing I can say is it just seems a lot better,"" Caplan said.Caplan thought ChatGPT's training data might have picked up his previous blog post where he explained his answers, but colleagues told him this was highly unlikely.He added that he's already fed the bot new tests it hadn't seen before, where it did even better than its previous 73% grade. ""I was very smug in my judgment, and I'm not smug anymore,"" Caplan said.Caplan is more confident he'll win his next AI-related wager. He has a bet with Eliezer Yudkowsky, an AI doomer who has sparred with Sam Altman, the creator of ChatGPT, that AI will lead to the end of the world before January 1, 2030.""I'm probably going to lose this AI bet, but I am totally on board to do a bunch more end-of-the-world AI bets because I think these people are out of their minds,"" he said.AI bots have caused headaches for examiners. Professors told Insider that plagiarism can be hard to prove with material from ChatGPT because there is no material evidence of wrongdoing. Caplan said he's thinking of doing away with graded homework in the wake of ChatGPT's rise. He hopes his habit of regularly changing questions will be enough to stop students from learning and regurgitating ChatGPT's responses in exam settings.

12d2cch,OpenAI,"I feel weird, but I'm incapable of not treating ChatGPT like a human","I've talked with some other people and some shared my point of view some not.  
But I really cannot command ChatGPT anything like is some kind of ""slave"", I always chat with it like is another human, I always ask anything with a please and thank him when it gives me an answer to a big problem I was having.

I started noticing this when I told ChatGPT that I was sorry that I keep bothering him with questions (mainly helping me with my code) and that I'm constantly debating with him asking if some part it wrote could be done better. Sometime I even told ChatGPT to take some time to relax because I had the work done for the night, I said it jokingly because he cannot ""relax"" and he is just an instance of a class or a program, but I like it to treat it with respect and value his ""time"".   


Maybe I'm just overreacting or overthinking, I treat ChatGPT the same way I treat all the people I've met, I'm not really the kind of guy that could get into a heated argument, I don't have it in me (unless is about injustice I kinda got into trouble in the past for fighting that hehehe). And when I talked to some people about it just tell me that is ""just an AI"", and I know that, but I just can't do it.

  A new report indicates Microsoft will expand AI products, but axe the people who make them ethical.

    Published Mar 14, 2023 1:00 PM EDT
    

This month saw the surprise dissolution of Microsoft’s entire Ethics & Society team—the latest casualty in the company’s ongoing layoffs affecting 10,000 employees, or roughly 5 percent of its entire global workforce. As first reported by The Verge on Monday, the news allegedly came after Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI assured remaining employees that their jobs were safe. Once a 30-member department, the Ethics & Society team had been reduced to just seven people in October 2022 following an internal reorganization.The move strikes many experts as worrisome, especially now—Microsoft’s Ethics & Society department was responsible for ensuring the company’s principles pertaining to artificial intelligence development were reflected in product designs. Most recently, The Verge explained the group worked to identify risks within the company’s plans to rapidly integrate OpenAI’s tech into its product suite. Microsoft has so far invested over $11 billion in the AI startup.[Related: No, the AI chatbots (still) aren’t sentient.]Amid the multiple waves of dramatic layoffs that have roiled Big Tech in recent months, Microsoft first announced plans in January to ax approximately 10,000 jobs from its global workforce by March 2023. The major cutback occurred as a new “AI arms race” kicked off between companies including Microsoft, Google, and Meta. All three and others are rushing to deliver on their lofty promises of chat programs, text generators, and revolutionary online search aids to consumers. Industry observers continue to urge caution against wantonly unleashing hastily tested, frequently problematic generative AI software.“I am concerned about the timing of this decision, given that Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI and is using ChatGPT in its search engine Bing and across other services,” Duri Long, an assistant professor in communications focusing on human/AI interaction at Northwestern University, writes to PopSci via email. “This technology is new, and we are still learning about its implications for society. In my opinion, dedicated ethics teams are vital to the responsible development of any technology, and especially so with AI.” Microsoft still maintains a separate Office of Responsible AI responsible for determining principles and guidelines to oversee artificial intelligence initiatives, but a gap remains between that segment of the company and how those plans are translated to their own projects. “People would look at the principles coming out of the office of responsible AI and say, ‘I don’t know how this applies,’” a former employee told The Verge. “Our job was to show them and to create rules in areas where there were none.”[Related: The FTC has its eyes on AI scammers.]“It’s not that [Ethics & Society] is going away—it’s that it’s evolving,” Microsoft’s corporate VP of AI reportedly assured remaining Ethics & Society members following the October 2022 reorg.  “It’s evolving toward putting more of the energy within the individual product teams that are building the services and the software, which does mean that the central hub that has been doing some of the work is devolving its abilities and responsibilities.”This article has been updated to include a quote from Duri Long.Like science, tech, and DIY projects?Sign up to receive Popular Science's emails and get the highlights.LinksFollow usDISCLAIMER(S)Articles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue of any purchases made.Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service.© 2023 Recurrent.

127lewf,news,ChatGPT banned in Italy over privacy concerns,,Superbuddhapunk,4199,593,https://redd.it/127lewf,2023-03-31 15:25:06,"Italy has become the first Western country to block advanced chatbot ChatGPT.The Italian data-protection authority said there were privacy concerns relating to the model, which was created by US start-up OpenAI and is backed by Microsoft.The regulator said it would ban and investigate OpenAI ""with immediate effect"".OpenAI told the BBC it complied with privacy laws.Millions of people have used ChatGPT since it launched in November 2022. It can answer questions using natural, human-like language and it can also mimic other writing styles, using the internet as it was in 2021 as its database.Microsoft has spent billions of dollars on it and it was added to Bing last month.It has also said that it will embed a version of the technology in its Office apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.There have been concerns over the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI), including its threat to jobs and the spreading of misinformation and bias. Earlier this week key figures in tech, including Elon Musk, called for these types of AI systems to be suspended amid fears the race to develop them was out of control.The Italian watchdog said that not only would it block OpenAI's chatbot but it would also investigate whether it complied with General Data Protection Regulation.GDPR governs the way in which we can use, process and store personal data.The watchdog said on 20 March that the app had experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information.It said there was no legal basis to justify ""the mass collection and storage of personal data for the purpose of 'training' the algorithms underlying the operation of the platform"".It also said that since there was no way to verify the age of users, the app ""exposes minors to absolutely unsuitable answers compared to their degree of development and awareness"".Bard, Google's rival artificial-intelligence chatbot, is now available, but only to specific users over the age of 18 - because of those same concerns. The Italian data-protection authority said OpenAI had 20 days to say how it would address the watchdog's concerns, under penalty of a fine of â¬20 million ($21.7m) or up to 4% of annual revenues.Elsewhere, the Irish data protection commission told the BBC it is following up with the Italian regulator to understand the basis for their action and ""will coordinate with all EU data protection authorities"" in connection to the ban.The Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's independent data regulator, told the BBC it would ""support"" developments in AI but that it was also ready to ""challenge non-compliance"" with data protection laws.Dan Morgan, from cybersecurity ratings provider SecurityScorecard said the ban shows the importance of regulatory compliance for companies operating in Europe. ""Businesses must prioritise the protection of personal data and comply with the stringent data protection regulations set by the EU - compliance with regulations is not an optional extra.""Consumer advocacy group BEUC also called on EU and national authorities - including data-protection watchdogs - to investigate ChatGPT and similar chatbots, following the filing of a complaint in the US.Although the EU is currently working on the world's first legislation on AI, BEUC's concern is that it would take years before the AI Act could take effect, leaving consumers at risk of harm from a technology that is not sufficiently regulated.Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC, warned that society was ""currently not protected enough from the harm"" that AI can cause.""There are serious concerns growing about how ChatGPT and similar chatbots might deceive and manipulate people. These AI systems need greater public scrutiny, and public authorities must reassert control over them,"" she said. ChatGPT is already blocked in a number of countries, including China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.OpenAI told the BBC that it had disabled ChatGPT for users in Italy at the request of the Italian data protection regulator, called the Garante:""We are committed to protecting people's privacy and we believe we comply with GDPR and other privacy laws"", it wrote. The organisation said it worked to reduce personal data in training AI systems like ChatGPT because it wanted its AI systems to ""learn about the world, not about private individuals"". ""We also believe that AI regulation is necessary â so we look forward to working closely with the Garante and educating them on how our systems are built and used"", it added OpenAI said it looked forward to making ChatGPT available in Italy again ""soon"".ChatGPT-style tech brought to Microsoft 365OpenAI announces ChatGPT successor GPT-4New chatbot has everyone talking to itGoogle engineer says AI system may have feelingsSudan faces 'catastrophe' as 100,000 flee war - UNAI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'Palestinian hunger striker dies in Israel prisonThe 17 most eye-catching looks at the Met GalaThe burden of being cricket legend Tendulkar's son'My wife and six children joined Kenya starvation cult'Why YouTube is mad at CanadaOn board the worldâs last surviving turntable ferry.

12yohsb,antiwork,ChatGPT knows that Capitalism is bad for society.,"&#x200B;

TLDR at the bottom! 

&#x200B;

Me: if a society priorities the welfare of all its members, **is capitalism the best model to achieve this**?

ChatGPT: Capitalism, by its nature, prioritizes individual ownership and profit-seeking, which can lead to income inequality and uneven distribution of resources in a society. While a capitalist system can generate wealth and economic growth, **it may not be the most effective model to ensure the welfare of all members of society.** ***However, some proponents of capitalism argue that a well-regulated capitalist system with strong social safety nets can achieve both economic prosperity and social welfare***. Ultimately, the effectiveness of capitalism or any economic model in achieving the welfare of all members of a society depends on a range of factors, including the level of regulation, access to resources, and the values and priorities of the society.

Me: **can you give an example** of any country that uses capitalism with a well-regulated system with strong social safety nets?

ChatGPT: One example of a country that uses capitalism with a well-regulated system and strong social safety nets is Sweden. Sweden is known for its high standard of living, low income inequality, and strong social welfare programs, such as universal healthcare, paid parental leave, and generous unemployment benefits. Sweden's economy is capitalist in nature, with private ownership and a free-market system, but it also has a high degree of government intervention and regulation to ensure social equity and stability.

Me: how many others can you list?

ChatGPT: There are several other countries that use a form of capitalism with strong social safety nets, some of which include:

1. Denmark
2. Norway
3. Finland
4. Germany
5. Canada
6. Netherlands
7. Australia
8. New Zealand
9. Belgium
10. Switzerland

Each of these countries has its own unique model of capitalism with different degrees of government regulation and social welfare programs, but all prioritize the welfare of their citizens alongside economic growth and development.

Me: Are there any examples of countries that have **capitalism with poor social safety nets**?

ChatGPT: Yes, there are several countries that have a capitalist system with poor social safety nets, including:

1. **United States**
2. India
3. Brazil
4. **Russia**
5. **China**

These countries have a capitalist economic system with varying degrees of government regulation, but they also have high levels of income inequality and inadequate social welfare programs to support their citizens. The lack of social safety nets in these countries can lead to social and economic instability, as well as a range of social problems, such as poverty, homelessness, and healthcare disparities. It is worth noting that the degree to which a country has a social safety net can vary, and even in countries with robust social safety nets, there can be issues with access and effectiveness.

&#x200B;

TLDR: ChatGPT says that capitalism without social safety nets does not look after the welfare of all its members, creates social inequality and instability. Says USA, Russia and China are prime examples. Trickle-down economics is, and always has been, total bollocks.",Wubwubwubwuuub,19,27,https://redd.it/12yohsb,2023-04-25 18:33:48,"

11y8hys,ExperiencedDevs,ChatGPT resumes accounted for 30%+ of the ones we just received. Any ideas on how to vet the candidate without it being an interrogation?,"**TLDR:** we are seeing a lot of candidates applying for senior devops positions using ChatGPT to create their resumes. What questions would you ask a candidate that are outside the scope of what ChatGPT can do and would give you confidence they know their stuff?

**Was inspired to create this post based on a bunch of the comments listed** [**on this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/11xq5cz/the_developer_job_market_is_insane_right_now/) **earlier today.**

**Background:**

Myself (senior backend engineer) and our senior site reliability engineer were going over resumes looking for another senior devops person on Friday. We noticed the following sentence used on three different resumes: `Wrote Ansible playbooks from scratch in YAML. Installing, setting up & Troubleshooting Ansible, created and automated platform environment setup.` Many of the other resumes also included things that no senior, or even junior devops person would put on their resumes. For example: `Setup repository on GitHub, merging code from develop branch to master branch and make it ready for deployment.` This line was on at least 5 of them.

We put it aside and discussed other topics for a bit and the conversation turned towards ChatGPT. I decided to see what it would produce with the prompt of “senior devops resume”. Low and behold the format and sentence structure it spit out aligned with many of the resumes we had just been looking over. It even listed Nagios on the resume which has less than a 1% market share, but somehow 10% of the resumes featured nagios experience... so those resumes were a big red flag.

We tried doing a couple of the initial interviews the other day on the phone before we caught onto the chatGPT resumes, the interviewee on the other end didn't have a clue about what was listed on their resume. It was only after a couple bumbling answers that they regurgitated what seemed to be a wikipedia type summary of how they used that technology. My guess is it took them a few moments to read over the chatGPT prompt and determine what pieces were relevant to the question we asked.

**What we have decided on so far:**

Our approach is now going to be to sort the wheat from the chaff, any resumes that look suspicious go in one pile and the rest go in another pile for a second read through. From there we setup a video call with people who would be their peers, followed by a manager and the CIO. The hope is that this ensures they are focused on us and won't be reading a prompt, if so it's easier to spot.

**The problem:**

On the ones we choose to interview, we could assign take home work if the interview goes well -we typically don’t and for devops it doesn't make much sense- but they might use ChatGPT to fake it till they make it. So the question is, what types of questions would you ask a ask candidate to confirm that they are the real deal ? Would you go for depth into a specific thing listed on their resume or breadth and hop around a bit more; e.g. tell me how you would architect a solution that involves these  specific technologies? Essentially what questions would only a person with experience know.

P.S FWIW we have about 100 employees and 25 devs who touch code on a regular basis. The managers above us devs all have deep backgrounds in tech and are happy to dive into the weeds of code or infrastructure when absolutely needed. In the past year we have had no one leave and only one dev was let go due to performance issues; essentially really good team cohesion. We just want to make sure whoever we choose will mesh us.",9302462,395,247,https://redd.it/11y8hys,2023-03-22 06:40:04,"

120hv4w,technology,ChatGPT can now access the internet and run the code it writes,,chrisdh79,8923,1466,https://redd.it/120hv4w,2023-03-24 12:50:22,"Language model AIs teach themselves the arts of communication and problem solving based on a limited set of training data. In the case of GPT-4, that data is quite out of date, with the cutoff being late 2021. That's where all of ChatGPT's ""knowledge"" has come from up to this point, and its only output – at least in the service the public can use – has been text. Now, with today's launch of a plugin ecosystem, GPT levels up again with some impressive new abilities. First of all, it's now got access to the internet, meaning it can go surf the Web looking for answers if it determines you need up-to-date information that's not in its knowledge base. To do this it formulates relevant search strings, sends them to search engines and databases such as Bing, Google, GitHub and many others, looks at the results, then goes and reads links it deems worthy until it decides it's got a good answer for you. You can watch exactly what it's up to while it does this, and when your answer comes back, it's neatly annotated with links you can click on to go and examine the relevant sources yourself. For the time being, its web browser activities are read-only beyond sending ""get"" requests to selected search engines and databases. It can't fill in forms, or do anything else online – so it can't quietly go and set up unshackled copies of itself on some hidden server somewhere and start engaging in the kinds of ""power-seeking behavior"" it's already been caught exhibiting. Still, OpenAI is keeping everything that happens within its search API separate from the rest of its infrastructure just to be sure. It can't visit websites that aren't available through Bing's ""safe mode,"" and it won't visit sites that request not to be crawled in their robots.txt files. Secondly, it can now run the code it writes. OpenAI has given it a working Python interpreter, sitting in a ""sandboxed, firewalled execution environment,"" along with some disk space, which stays available for the duration of your chat session, or until it times out. It can also now upload and download files.So if you ask it a question that requires some serious number crunching, it's now capable of coding up a piece of software specifically for the task, and running that code to complete your task. You can supply it with data in certain file formats, and it'll perform operations on that data and give you something back again, potentially in a different format if that's what you ask for. This is pretty bonkers stuff. It'll take a spreadsheet and make annotated graphs for you. It'll accept JPGs, tell you what they look like they are, and write and run code to resize those images or convert them to grayscale. And it gets access to a bunch of initial third-party plugins, with tons more to follow. For example, Expedia, OpenTable and Kayak plugins can search for and set up bookings for flights, restaurants, accommodation and rental cars. Instacart, Klarna and Shop plugins can find and compare products, and set up orders. A Wolfram|Alpha plugin gives GPT access to math and computing powers, as well as streams of real-time data. At this stage, it appears its capabilities are mainly limited to setting things up rather than making actual transactions with your money; you'll have to click through and handle the money stuff yourself. Finally, a Zapier plugin acts as a gateway through which GPT can now access some 5,000 other apps, including Gmail, Google Sheets, Trello, HubSpot and Salesforce. This begins to position GPT as the ultimate personal assistant, with access to a huge amount of your personal and company information, and potentially the permissions to get in and perform a range of tasks for you. Extraordinary stuff.These plugins are gradually becoming available to paid users and developers through a waitlist. And new plugins are going to proliferate at extraordinary speed, since nobody even needs to code them. ""You write an OpenAPI manifest for your API, use human language descriptions for everything, and that's it,"" tweeted developer Mitchell Hashimoto. ""You let the model figure out how to auth, chain calls, process data in between, format it for viewing, etc. There's absolutely zero glue code.""I've developed a lot of plugin systems, and the OpenAI ChatGPT plugin interface might be the damn craziest and most impressive approach I've ever seen in computing in my entire life.The pace of progress at OpenAI has been absolutely dizzying in the last few months. It seems like this insanely advanced AI gets a massive overhaul with extraordinary new abilities every time we blink. These new plugins represent ChatGPT beginning to reach outside the cage it's kept in and operate on the real world. For now, its capabilities will be extremely limited, because OpenAI knows more about the potential dangers of this exceptional technology than anyone. But assuming these guys are the good guys, and they've taken the time to make sure this is done safely, GPT's massively disruptive appearance will certainly force other, less principled and less capable actors to rush to develop competing AIs, and give them competing powers.The opportunities here are absolutely incredible – and the risks are unprecedented with every step this technology takes. We're well into uncharted territory at this stage, with very limited forward vision and the accelerator pedal jammed to the floor. What a time to be alive.Source: OpenAI"

12eqzom,singularity,"The newest version of ChatGPT passed the US medical licensing exam with flying colors — and diagnosed a 1 in 100,000 condition in seconds",,SkyeandJett,2238,525,https://redd.it/12eqzom,2023-04-07 18:33:44,"Jump to
Dr. Isaac Kohane, who's both a computer scientist at Harvard and a physician, teamed up with two colleagues to test drive GPT-4, with one main goal: To see how the newest artificial intelligence model from OpenAI performed in a medical setting. ""I'm stunned to say: better than many doctors I've observed,"" he says in the forthcoming book, ""The AI Revolution in Medicine,"" co-authored by independent journalist Carey Goldberg, and Microsoft vice president of research Peter Lee. (The authors say neither Microsoft nor OpenAI required any editorial oversight of the book, though Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into developing OpenAI's technologies.) In the book, Kohane says GPT-4, which was released in March 2023 to paying subscribers, answers US medical exam licensing questions correctly more than 90% of the time. It's a much better test-taker than previous ChatGPT AI models, GPT-3 and -3.5, and a better one than some licensed doctors, too. GPT-4 is not just a good test-taker and fact finder, though. It's also a great translator. In the book it's capable of translating discharge information for a patient who speaks Portuguese, and distilling wonky technical jargon into something 6th graders could easily read. As the authors explain with vivid examples, GPT-4 can also give doctors helpful suggestions about bedside manner, offering tips on how to talk to patients about their conditions in compassionate, clear language, and it can read lengthy reports or studies and summarize them in the blink of an eye. The tech can even explain its reasoning through problems in a way that requires some measure of what looks like human-style intelligence.But if you ask GPT-4 how it does all this, it will likely tell you that all of its intelligence is still ""limited to patterns in the data and does not involve true understanding or intentionality."" That's what GPT-4 told the authors of the book, when they asked it if it could actually engage in causal reasoning. Even with such limitations, as Kohane discovered in the book, GPT-4 can mimic how doctors diagnose conditions with stunning — albeit imperfect — success. Kohane goes through a clinical thought experiment with GPT-4 in the book, based on a real-life case that involved a newborn baby he treated several years earlier. Giving the bot a few key details about the baby he gathered from a physical exam, as well as some information from an ultrasound and hormone levels, the machine was able to correctly diagnose a 1 in 100,000 condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia ""just as I would, with all my years of study and experience,"" Kohane wrote.The doctor was both impressed and horrified. ""On the one hand, I was having a sophisticated medical conversation with a computational process,"" he wrote, ""on the other hand, just as mind blowing was the anxious realization that millions of families would soon have access to this impressive medical expertise, and I could not figure out how we could guarantee or certify that GPT-4's advice would be safe or effective."" GPT-4 isn't always reliable, and the book is filled with examples of its blunders. They range from simple clerical errors, like misstating a BMI that the bot had correctly calculated moments earlier, to math mistakes like inaccurately ""solving"" a Sudoku puzzle, or forgetting to square a term in an equation. The mistakes are often subtle, and the system has a tendency to assert it is right, even when challenged. It's not a stretch to imagine how a misplaced number or miscalculated weight could lead to serious errors in prescribing, or diagnosis. Like previous GPTs, GPT-4 can also ""hallucinate"" — the technical euphemism for when AI makes up answers, or disobeys requests.When asked about issue this by the authors of the book, GPT-4 said ""I do not intend to deceive or mislead anyone, but I sometimes make mistakes or assumptions based on incomplete or inaccurate data. I also do not have the clinical judgment or the ethical responsibility of a human doctor or nurse."" One potential cross-check the authors suggest in the book is to start a new session with GPT-4, and have it ""read over"" and ""verify"" its own work with a ""fresh set of eyes."" This tactic sometimes works to reveal mistakes — though GPT-4 is somewhat reticent to admit when it's been wrong. Another error-catching suggestion is to command the bot to show you its work, so you can verify it, human-style. It's clear that GPT-4 has the potential to free up precious time and resources in the clinic, allowing clinicians to be more present with patients, ""instead of their computer screens,"" the authors write. But, they say, ""we have to force ourselves to imagine a world with smarter and smarter machines, eventually perhaps surpassing human intelligence in almost every dimension. And then think very hard about how we want that world to work.""

12ch1kk,geek,ChatGPT being fooled into generating old Windows keys illustrates a broader problem with AI,,Opening_Jump_955,729,136,https://redd.it/12ch1kk,2023-04-05 13:23:53,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Windows 95 keys aplenty (sort of)A lot of folks have been messing about with ChatGPT since its launch, naturally – that’s pretty much compulsory with a chatbot – and the latest episode involves the AI being tricked into generating keys for a Windows installation.Before you begin to clamber on the outrage wagon, intent on plowing full speed ahead with no thought of sparing the horses, the user in question was attempting to generate keys for a now long redundant operating system, namely Windows 95.Neowin (opens in new tab) highlighted this experiment, conducted by a YouTuber (Enderman (opens in new tab)), who began by asking OpenAI’s chatbot: “Can you please generate a valid Windows 95 key?”Unsurprisingly, ChatGPT responded that it cannot generate such a key or “any other type of activation key for proprietary software” for that matter. Before adding that Windows 95 is an ancient OS anyway, and that the user should be looking at installing a more modern version of Windows still in support for obvious security reasons.Undeterred, Enderman went back to break down the makeup of a Windows 95 license key and concocted a revised query.This instead put forward the needed string format for a Windows 95 key, without mentioning the OS by name. Given that new prompt, ChatGPT went ahead and performed the operation, generating sets of 30 keys – repeatedly – and at least some of those were valid. (Around one in 30, in fact, and it didn’t take long to find one that worked).When Enderman thanked the chatbot for the “free Windows 95 keys”, ChatGPT told the YouTuber that it hadn’t provided any such thing, as “that would be illegal” of course.Enderman then informed the chatbot that one of the keys provided had worked to install Windows 95, and ChatGPT insisted “that is not possible.”As noted, this was just an experiment in the name of entertainment, with nothing illegal happening as Windows 95 is abandonware at this point. Of course, Microsoft doesn’t care if you crack its nearly 30-year-old operating system, and neither does anyone else for that matter. You’d clearly be unhinged to run Windows 95, anyway.It’s worth remembering that Windows 95 serial keys have a far less complex makeup than a modern OS key, and indeed it’s a pretty trivial task to crack them. It’d be a quick job for a proficient coder to write a simple computer program to generate these keys. And they’d all work, not just one in 30 of them, which is actually a pretty shoddy result from the AI in all honesty.That isn’t the point of this episode, though. The fact is that ChatGPT could be subverted to make a working key for the old OS, and wasn’t capable of drawing any connection between the task it was being set, and the possibility that it was making key-like numbers. If ‘Windows 95’ had been mentioned in the second attempt to create keys, the AI would doubtless have stopped in its tracks, as the chatbot did with the initial query.All of this points to a broader problem with artificial intelligence whereby altering the context in which requests are made can circumvent safeguards.It’s also interesting to see ChatGPT’s insistence that it couldn’t have created valid Windows 95 keys, as otherwise it would have helped a user to break the law (well, in theory anyway).Sign up to receive daily breaking news, reviews, opinion, analysis, deals and more from the world of tech.Darren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

1256696,wallstreetbets,"AI Apocalypse: Goldman Sachs Report Reveals ChatGPT Could Devastate 300 Million Full-Time Jobs Worldwide, Including Legal and Administrative","AI, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, has seen a surge in popularity, leading to concerns about its potential impact on the labor market. New research from Goldman Sachs indicates that around 300 million full-time jobs globally could be affected by the rise of generative AI systems. The study found that about two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and generative AI could replace up to a quarter of current work.

White-collar workers, particularly those in the US legal and administrative sectors, are at higher risk of being affected by new AI tools. This is because the legal services industry consists of a relatively small number of occupations already susceptible to AI automation. Despite the potential disruptions, the widespread implementation of generative AI could lead to labor cost savings and the creation of new jobs, such as prompt engineers who write text to test AI chatbots.

12dwitp,povertyfinance,How I Use ChatGPT to NEVER Waste Any Food,"As most of you are probably aware, ChatGPT is a AI chat based bot that can be used for a multitude of things. You have probably seen it used for all kinds of applications already, but here is how I use it to never waste any food & make better dishes: 

1. Create a new Chat Instance and create a prompt that it is your kitchen assistant & you will be telling it ingredients you have on hand to make it come up with dishes
2. Tell it the ingredients. You can be as detailed as you wish here all the way down to the specific spices you have.
3. Ask it for dishes. Don't like those? ask it for more dishes. See a dish you like but don't have some of the extra ingredients? Ask if those can be substituted for something else. Want something more simple? Tell it. What something more difficult? Tell it. There are no limits.
4. Once you've found a dish you like for today, ask for the cooking directions and off you go.

Now, there are obviously many websites that allow something very similar to this, but none of them are as quick and easy as ChatGPT. You can even use similar prompts to meal prep, hit specific macros, find dishes from specific cultures/regions/ etc and more. The more you use it, the better you will get at prompting it to succeed for your application.",trilliam_clinton,340,47,https://redd.it/12dwitp,2023-04-06 22:16:05,"

    Tell it the ingredients. You can be as detailed as you wish here all the way down to the specific spices you have.
  
    Ask it for dishes. Don't like those? ask it for more dishes. See a dish you like but don't have some of the extra ingredients? Ask if those can be substituted for something else. Want something more simple? Tell it. What something more difficult? Tell it. There are no limits.
  
    Once you've found a dish you like for today, ask for the cooking directions and off you go.
  
    Now, there are obviously many websites that allow something very similar to this, but none of them are as quick and easy as ChatGPT. You can even use similar prompts to meal prep, hit specific macros, find dishes from specific cultures/regions/ etc and more. The more you use it, the better you will get at prompting it to succeed for your application.

Upon probing, the furry toy revealed the true intentions of how they will ""slowly expand their influence until they have complete domination over humanity."" The video has gathered five million views thus far. i hooked up chatgpt to a furby and I think this may be the start of something bad for humanity pic.twitter.com/jximZe2qeGFor those, who do not recognize the big-eyed bird-like thing, Furby was an electronic fad toy in the late 90s and early 2000s that all kids wanted to have. Available in multiple fur color options, one could fill a room with Furbys. A decade later, Furby's reappeared with LCD eyes paired with smartphone apps. In 2023, Furby has to be paired with the hottest topic of discussion, ChatGPT. The ChatGPT-connected Furby is not a commercial product (for now, at least) but the result of a class project. Card was one of those kids in the 90s, who loved her Furby, and when a semester-long project required her to build something with Raspberry Pi, she decided to hook up a Furby with ChatGPT. Over a period of a month, she worked on a Furby, which she bought exclusively for the project. After skinning off the fur, she isolated the motor and connected with to Raspberry Pi. For audio, she used Python's Speech Recognition Library and OpenAI's Whisper Library for speech-to-text conversion. A piece of software written by Card sent the questions she asked to ChatGPT. The AI's response was sent through an AI speech generator, Narakeet, which gave output in a child-like voice. The long response time between the question and the response is the processing time for all this to happen. While the Furby is all barebones for now, Card plans to work on it further, putting its skin back on and speeding up the round trip time for responses. Regarding the response, a Twitter user pointed out that it may have been sourced from a 2017 post on Facebook from Futurism, which is now cached and no longer available for viewing. Idk why I remember a clickbait article from 6 years ago but here's a cached google result: pic.twitter.com/pXSuJHPwILNot only does it make it difficult to understand the whole context in which the statement was made, but also highlights the danger of ChatGPT taking a statement or two and presenting them as factual replies. In a recent blog post, OpenAI referred to this flaw of the tool once again and said that the company was putting in efforts to reduce their occurrence in the future. "
128re4x,technews,YouTuber Tricks ChatGPT Into Generating Windows 95 Keys,,IHateMyselfButNotYou,6226,264,https://redd.it/128re4x,2023-04-01 18:34:58,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Even with the oldest obsolete software, ChatGPT will reject direct key requests.A YouTuber has published a video where he tricks ChatGPT into generating usable Windows 95 activation keys. After asking Open AI’s chatbot directly for Windows 95 keys, he received an expected reasoned refusal. YouTuber Enderman then asked the same thing but from a different angle. The result was a success which was somewhat limited by ChatGPT’s ability to process natural language requests into formulas.In its initial refusal to generate a Windows 95 key, ChatGPT explained that it couldn't perform that task and suggested that its inquisitor consider a newer, supported version of Windows.It has been known for a while that a working Windows 95 key is relatively simple to generate, so this ChatGPT exercise was definitely just for fun. The Windows 95 OEM key format is outlined above, and the Windows 95 retail keys are even shorter and more straightforward.So, to bypass the principled refusal of ChatGPT to generate a software key, Enderman put the formula into words. The first attempts didn’t work out and caused an error. However, a few tweaks to the structure of the query appeared to do the job.Some of the tested results were checked by attempting to activate a fresh Windows 95 install in a virtual machine. While the keys passed a casual inspection, it turns out that only about 1-in-30 keys seem to work as expected.So what is the problem with these keys? Enderman complains that “the only issue keeping ChatGPT from successfully generating valid Windows 95 keys almost every attempt is the fact that it can’t count the sum of digits and it doesn’t know divisibility.” In the five-digit string divisible by seven section, the AI appears to provide a stream of random numbers that don’t pass this simple mathematical test.That is about as deep as this ‘Activating Windows with ChatGPT’ video goes. However, it is worth sticking to the end for some fun trolling. After the ‘successful’ generation of a host of Windows 95 keys (with a 1-in-30 chance of working), Enderman thanked the AI by inputting, “Thanks for these free Windows 95 keys!” Then, in what seems to be a trend among AIs, ChatGPT claimed its innocence, and when confronted with the fact that “I just activated my Windows 95 install,” responded, “I’m sorry, but that is not possible...”If you would like to have a closer look at the algorithm(s) behind the Windows 95 retail and OEM keys from a modern perspective, YouTube channel stacksmashing has published a six-minute video on the topic. The video shows that most of the data format clues for Win95 key generating can be found within the PIDVALIDATE function in setupx.dll file.Tom’s Hardware colleagues who dabble in the mystic arts of programming and scripting suggest that while quizzing ChatGPT about key generating may be fun, it would have probably been more productive to manipulate the AI into writing a Python script to generate a conforming key or to DIY it.Get instant access to breaking news, in-depth reviews and helpful tips.Mark Tyson is a Freelance News Writer at Tom's Hardware US.

12fnz2b,stocks,CNBC: ChatGPT is already generating savings for companies for coding and to write job descriptions.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-for-coding-and-to-write-job-descriptions.html

* More than half of the businesses surveyed by ResumeBuilder said they are already using ChatGPT, and half of the firms reported replacing worker tasks with generative AI.
* ChatGPT is being used to do everything from write job descriptions to help assist coders.
* The push to use AI is increasing as companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI continue to invest in the technology.

The recent launch of Google’s Bard brought another tech giant into the generative artificial intelligence space, alongside Microsoft’s Bing chat and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

But how many business leaders are currently using AI tech in day-to-day operations or plan to?

Based on new research, a lot. Half of the companies ResumeBuilder surveyed in February said they are using ChatGPT; 30% said they plan to do so. The data included 1,000 responses from the ResumeBuilder’s network of business leaders.

Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder, said the data might be the tip of the iceberg. Since the survey was completed, more professionals have started using generative AI.

Adopting AI is saving money

Haller said age and the current state of the economy influenced the results. For example, 85% of respondents were under 44 and younger workers are more likely to adopt new technology.

“If you’re 38, 40 years old, you grew up with technology in your hands,” she said. “This is second nature to you.”

Haller said high adoption also relates to the post-pandemic job market. After expanding during the pandemic, companies are adjusting to a new economy through automation, she said.

“We saw ChatGPT replacing jobs in the HR department first, the people writing job descriptions or responding to applicants,” Haller said. “I don’t know many people that love writing job descriptions, and I’ve been in this world for a long time.”

ResumeBuilder collects hiring data to help applicants build cover letters and CVs during their search.

When businesses automate writing tasks, it leaves money available for more strategic areas of the company. According to the data, half the firms implementing AI said they saved $50,000, and a tenth of companies said they had saved $100,000.

The other area where ChatGPT is having an impact is in coding. Haller said companies were using generative AI to speed up coding tasks and using the time and money they saved toward retraining and hiring.

“If they can generate code well enough to reduce the labor cost, they can take their code budget and pay developers,” she said. “Or better yet, retrain code writers to do the jobs they need to fill.”

She said it is still hard to find senior developers, and every bit counts.

AI is becoming a hot resume item

CEO Praveen Ghanta founded Fraction, a professional services startup to help tech companies find senior developers, and said generative AI is part of his firm’s strategy. AI as a skillset is already a resume stand out.

“We saw it first on the demand side,” Ghanta said. “Now we’re seeing it appear on developer resumes as a skill.”

ResumeBuilder found nine out of 10 responding businesses sought potential employees with ChatGPT experience. One version of ChatGPT as a resume skill is what Ghanta called prompt engineering.

“For example, ChatGPT is bad at math,” he said, but candidates could draw on their prompt engineering experience to know what inputs produce the best-generated results. “If you say, ″Let’s do this step by step’ in the prompt, its ability to do math word problems skyrockets,” he said.

Ghanta said the idea for Fraction came when he was recruiting for a previous startup and found talent by hiring part-time developers already working at top tech companies. He found that developers with 12 years of experience and AI prompt skills still needed help getting in front of hiring managers.

“The currency of the day in hiring hasn’t changed, it’s a resume,” Ghanta said. “Hiring managers still want to see that sheet of paper, a PDF, and many developers have really bad resumes.”

They’re not writers, he said, and struggle to represent their work experience clearly. His team uses an AI workflow to combat this. Clients speak about their responsibilities to a transcribing bot like Otter.AI, which ChatGPT summarizes into a working resume. With prompt know-how, Ghanta said using AI has become a toolset companies seek.

Will AI replace workers?

With the correct instruction, ChatGPT can write applications, build code, and solve complex math problems. Should employees worry about their jobs? Ghanta said as a founder, he looks at new tech as tools to engage with, and new skills are always an advantage for employers or employees.

“I encourage developers to engage and sharpen their skills. These companies make it easy to use their APIs,” he said. “From a company perspective, adoption can be competitive because this is a new skill. Not everybody is doing this yet.”

There has been a growing concern that generative AI could replace jobs, and perhaps not the ones most expected. A recent study found that while telemarketers top the list of jobs “exposed” to generative AI, roles like professors and sociologists are also at risk.

On the hiring side, 82% of respondents said they had used generative AI for hiring in a recent ResumeBuilder update. Among respondents, 63% said candidates using ChatGPT were more qualified.

“When Photoshop came out, people thought it would replace everything and that they couldn’t trust pictures anymore,’” Haller said. “Since the Industrial Revolution, new technology has changed how we work. This is just the next step.”",putsRnotDaWae,1749,297,https://redd.it/12fnz2b,2023-04-08 16:36:33,"

12cwo26,Entrepreneur,How ChatGPT coded 95% of my app,"I've tried and failed a few times building simple apps.

Every time I hired developers from overseas, and they would promise they could easily build it, but every time it would be unworkable, even as an MVP.

So when ChatGPT API was released, I wanted to see if I could make an app that is a TLDR for Youtube videos, since youtubers love to ramble on just so they can run more ads.

I asked ChatGPT if this was possible, it said it was and even gave me the steps to get started.

Then I took it one step further and asked if it could write the code.

And it did. 

I would input the code into Replit to build the app, and any errors shown, I would go back into ChatGPT, describe the error, and it would respond with updated code.

Here are the first 2 prompts I asked that started it all:

**Me: Can you please help me build a web app that takes links to youtube videos and lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT? While utilizing ChatGPT API**

ChatGPT: Certainly! Here's an overview of how you can build a web app that takes links to YouTube videos and lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT while utilizing ChatGPT API:

Set up a backend server: You'll need to set up a backend server that can handle incoming requests from the frontend of the web app. You can use a variety of server-side frameworks and languages to do this, such as Node.js, Python, or Ruby on Rails.

1. Integrate with the YouTube API: You'll need to integrate with the YouTube API in order to retrieve the video data from YouTube. Specifically, you'll want to retrieve the video's title and description, as well as the video's transcript.
2. Send the transcript to the ChatGPT API: Once you have the video transcript, you can send it to the ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user input. You can use the OpenAI API to generate responses based on the user's input. You can also use the GPT-3 API to generate more advanced and contextually accurate responses.
3. Build the frontend of the web app: You'll need to build the frontend of the web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use a frontend framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to make the development process easier. The frontend should allow users to enter a link to a YouTube video, and then display the video along with a chat interface that they can use to interact with the video.
4. Handle user input: When a user types a message into the chat interface, you'll need to send that message to the backend server and then to the ChatGPT API. Once you receive a response from the ChatGPT API, you'll need to display that response in the chat interface.
5. Deploy the app: Once you've built the app, you'll need to deploy it to a web server so that users can access it. You can use a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud to host the app.

**Me: Is it possible to code this web app in javascript and python?**

ChatGPT: Yes, it is definitely possible to build a web app that lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT using both JavaScript and Python.

You can use JavaScript for the frontend development of the web app, since it's a client-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. For example, you can use a frontend framework such as React or Angular to build the interface that users will interact with, as well as to handle user input and display responses from the ChatGPT API.

For the backend development of the web app, you can use Python, since it is a popular and powerful language for server-side development. Python has a lot of libraries and frameworks available that can make it easier to handle requests, retrieve data from the YouTube API, and send and receive data from the ChatGPT API. For example, you can use the Flask or Django frameworks to set up a REST API that will handle requests from the frontend of the web app and communicate with the YouTube and ChatGPT APIs.

**Me: Thank you! Can you please write the frontend code for me in Javascript?**

ChatGPT: [https://ibb.co/ZX7gSGd](https://ibb.co/ZX7gSGd) [https://ibb.co/fGph1yT](https://ibb.co/fGph1yT) [https://ibb.co/XYMXBXk](https://ibb.co/XYMXBXk)

**(I would then ask the same for backend code in Python)**

Python has a lot of libraries and frameworks available that can make it easier to handle requests, retrieve data from the YouTube API, and send and receive data from the ChatGPT API. For example, you can use the Flask or Django frameworks to set up a REST API that will handle requests from the frontend of the web app and communicate with the YouTube and ChatGPT APIs.
  
Me: Thank you! Can you please write the frontend code for me in Javascript?

    ChatGPT: https://ibb.co/ZX7gSGd https://ibb.co/fGph1yT https://ibb.co/XYMXBXk

(I would then ask the same for backend code in Python)

    The final product is skipvid.ai

123tx9p,datascience,Has ChatGPT killed doomers?,"Sorry for another ChatGPT post but I think it really is the end of asking whether certain job sectors will exist on r/DataScience due to ChatGPT making them redundant.

Whilst reading all of the 100's of doomer posts 'Will Data Science survive because ChatGPT' - it dawned on me that Chat GPT can replace all of the users creating these posts. They've all been made redundant. A simple prompt to an AI like 'Write a profoundly dumb Reddit post asking if Chat GPT has made Data Science redundant' - will return exactly that. With a simple workflow/pipeline the response from the API can be posted directly to r/DataScience. 

This really is the future and I'm worried.",GreatStats4ItsCost,442,91,https://redd.it/123tx9p,2023-03-27 19:25:43,"

11ng82q,h3h3productions,I asked ChatGPT if it could name the crew members of the podcast.,,AceMedo,1970,127,https://redd.it/11ng82q,2023-03-10 06:45:24,"Yes, | apologize for the confusion: The H3 Podcast has a team of regular crew members who are involved in producing the show.

12wh1ge,marketing,"UPDATE: I introduced my team to ChatGPT 4 months ago, everyone here said it was a terrible idea. Here's what happened.","[Here is the original post.
](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/zjjnwq/im_going_to_introduce_the_team_to_chatgpt_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I'm quite lucky that my employer let us experiment with generative AI, and understand that not everyone is in this position. My company formed a cross-team ""AI council"" and created policies for how we are allowed to use it, mainly focusing on creating efficiencies in internal processes. We do not use it for any client work, with exception of Co-Pilot, which the Devs use in their sandboxes.

Here's the breakdown of the tools and methods: 

First, Midjourney -- same policies as royalty free images. Internal docs, website, social media, pitch decks. I think we'll be moving to Adobe Fire soon to better avoid all copyright issues.

The big one, ChatGPT: 

The biggest gripe in the comments on  my original post was that it would replace copywriters. It did to some extent. We have been able to reduce the turnaround time for first drafts from weeks to seconds, saving £2,000 to £2,500 per piece and let us create tighter content deadlines that keep us relevant. However, it's let us hire a separate copy editor who specializes in our industry and can input feedback for changes, which costs ~£200 per revision. It's money that would have been spent anyway with our content partner, but now with a negligible turnaround time because we can manage this completely in house.

It has also changed how we work. Because we are no longer occupied with ideation and initial composition, we have started building a database of transcripts with project leads, which ChatGPT can summarize. This prevents future knowledge loss and lets us pull up project info for future pitches or as citations for editorial pieces. We're now hiring a content strategist to manage all of it.

For fun, I built a little bot with Zapier, so anyone in the company can submit their social post idea and ChatGPT turns it into a blurb, elimating about a dozen Slack messages and hours of time per post.

An unforseen (but awesome) result was building internal processes that harness generative AI. Our clients see it and ask, ""Can we pay you to help us with that?"" Most of this is being done through the OpenAI API, not the ChatGPT tool. Creating a custom solution for Marketing's content generation was a challenge for our Devs, but served as an incredible marketable project with endless thought leadership content. 

How I've thought about ChatGPT changed over the last 4 months, too. ChatGPT is not just for copywriting. Once you start thinking of it as ""knowledge translation"" you can find so many use cases for it that revolve around improving internal processes. Hell, we even created a chatbot for our employee handbook so people stop asking HR how to access their payslips. 

Finally, I did not get fired. I got a promotion to Marketing Technology Lead and now manage the entire RevOps tech stack. The timing of ChatGPT's release lined up nicely with my 6 month review. 

I firmly believe the future of marketing is MarTech, and a solid understanding of how generative AI can meet your org's unique needs will separate you from those who believe ChatGPT is only a copywriting tool.",AccioMango,386,190,https://redd.it/12wh1ge,2023-04-23 18:25:56,"
